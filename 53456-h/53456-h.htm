<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="27" /></div><h2 id="c1"><br /><i>BETH AND THE TWILIGHT STAR</i></h2>
<p>Beth Harrison and her father
had driven into the desert to look for dead
branches of &ldquo;jumping cactus,&rdquo; which were used
in making lamps for Mr. Harrison&rsquo;s tourist
shop in Tucson. He and Beth had just gotten
out of the station wagon and were gazing up a
slope of bristly cacti.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;This looks like a good place, Daddy,&rdquo; Beth
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Harrison nodded. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to hurry,
though. It&rsquo;s getting late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started up the sandy slope carrying
straw market bags that would hold their gleanings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll see some Flying Saucers,&rdquo;
Beth said half-jokingly. &ldquo;Someone thought he
saw one out here the other day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father grinned. &ldquo;Flying Saucers indeed!
You and that lively imagination of yours,
Beth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They set to work searching for dead
branches. They found a few good specimens.
But they were not enough to suit Beth and
she decided to broaden the search. She went
over the slope and up and down another, and
before long her roaming carried her out of
sight of her father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Amidst the stunning colors of the sunset,
Beth could make out a lone star&mdash;Sirius&mdash;the
brightest true star in all the sky. It reminded
her of a pearl glowing in the heavens.</p>
<p>Presently Beth had a bag full of cactus wood
for the lamp shop. She was about to return to
her father when suddenly she saw something
ahead that she had not noticed before. Almost
hidden within a dense thicket of smoky green
<i>paloverde</i> was a shiny surface that reflected
the dying sun&rsquo;s rays. Her imagination stirred,
Beth decided to investigate.</p>
<p>She put down her bag and made her way
into the thicket. As she moved carefully
through the thorns, she found some of the
branches pushed aside as if someone had used
this path before. She was almost through when
she tripped and fell head-first. Her forehead
bumped against an unyielding branch, causing
her to see more than one star this time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t know how long she lay on the
ground half-stunned before she got to her
feet. There was a painful bruise on her forehead,
but her curiosity was still strong and she
went on. The shiny surface turned out to be
a wall as smooth and glossy as steel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeepers!&rdquo; Beth thought. &ldquo;What can it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She reached out to touch the wall. Before
she could do so, a door opened in the wall.</p>
<p>The first thing she noticed beyond was a
soft yellow light filling a handsome room. Feeling
like Alice on the threshold of Wonderland,
she stepped inside, more thrilled than afraid.</p>
<p>She heard a sighing behind her and saw the
door closing shut. Only then did she become
frightened. She beat against the wall, wishing
that she had not been so rash as to venture
into such a strange place.</p>
<p>She heard a voice say, &ldquo;That will not help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beth turned and saw a girl of about her own
age standing on a richly-carpeted platform
across the room. The odd unearthliness of the
girl struck Beth immediately. She was pretty
and her skin was milky white. Her costume
seemed to be of a blue phosphorescent material,
as did her shoes. Her short hair was almost as
red as glowing coals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wh&mdash;who are you?&rdquo; Beth stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Linnia,&rdquo; the girl replied in a voice
that sounded almost as if she were singing.
&ldquo;You are Beth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Beth replied in amazement, &ldquo;but
how did you&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can read your mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beth gulped. &ldquo;You can?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come over and sit down,&rdquo; Linnia said.
&ldquo;We shall talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat in a nearby chair that seemed to be
made of steel matchsticks, it looked so frail.
Beth sat in the chair opposite and found that
it was very sturdy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are thinking that I look very strange
to you,&rdquo; Linnia said. &ldquo;You seem strange to me
too, but that is because we are of different
worlds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beth gulped again. &ldquo;D&mdash;different worlds?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Suddenly the yellow light in the room
changed to a pulsing orange. Linnia straightened
up quickly. &ldquo;That is the signal,&rdquo; she
spoke. &ldquo;I did not expect it so soon. We must
hurry and prepare ourselves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beth started asking questions, but Linnia
said not now. Beth found herself following the
girl across the room to a row of couches. Beth
lay down on one and somehow knew exactly
what she was to do. She guessed that Linnia
was putting the thoughts into her head. She
lifted the straps that hung at the sides and
buckled them across her body.</p>
<p>The couch was soft as a cloud and Beth
was thinking how much she would like to
have a bed like this when all at once she felt
herself sinking deeply into the cushion as if
a great hand were thrusting her down. For
several moments she was as giddy as if she
were riding the roller-coaster at the carnival.
Then finally her breath came back and she
felt herself rise to the top of the cushion again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can get up,&rdquo; she heard Linnia say.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re coasting now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>They unbuckled their straps and rose to
their feet. Linnia walked over to the wall,
pressed a button, and a blind rolled back,
revealing a long window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; Linnia said.</p>
<p>Beth joined her and looked out the window.
Her heart fairly rose into her throat. She was
up in the sky, far up in the sky! Through a
veil of clouds beneath she could see the curve
of the earth itself!</p>
<p>Beth seized Linnia by the arm. &ldquo;Jeepers,
what&rsquo;s going on! Where are you taking me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linnia pointed to the white beacon of Sirius
in the blue-black sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re from Sirius?&rdquo; Beth asked in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, from Tata Moori, one of its planets.
Our work on earth is through for right now
and my father and I are returning home to
make a report.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Linnia went on to say that her father&rsquo;s space
ship was only one of many which were studying
the earth to see how the people here lived.
Her father&rsquo;s assignment had been to make an
analysis of the soil. The visitors intended no
harm and in time they planned to meet the
people of earth face to face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have already met you,&rdquo; Beth said
boldly, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m ready to go back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linnia shook her flame-topped head. &ldquo;We
tried to keep our ship hidden, but you found
it, Beth, and so there is nothing to do but take
you back with us for awhile. When you came
close, the electric eye opened the door and let
you inside before it was time for any earth
person to see one of our ships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my father and mother,&rdquo; Beth said
desperately, &ldquo;and my friends! They&rsquo;ll be worried
to death! You must not take me, Linnia!
Please, isn&rsquo;t there something you can do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linnia studied Beth&rsquo;s pleading face. Then
she replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to my father. He&rsquo;s busy
running the ship, but I&rsquo;ll do what I can for
you. While I&rsquo;m gone, you can see what it&rsquo;s like
on our world by pushing the button on that
cabinet against the wall. Father and I look at
the film sometimes to keep from getting homesick.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Beth was in no mood for looking at pictures.
She was feeling worse by the minute as
she considered what it would be like to be
parted from her family and friends. As she sat
in the chair, dreading and wondering, suddenly
it became too much for her and she
began to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeepers, why did I ever wander off from
Daddy?&rdquo; she moaned.</p>
<p>The tears made her feel better and presently
she was calm enough to go over to the cabinet
and turn it on. A large screen brightened and
she saw a strange land unfolding before her
eyes.</p>
<p>There were winding highways raised into
the sky and skyscrapers like tall crystal columns.
She saw motorcars of tear-drop design
and helicopters filling the air. The people
looked much like Linnia, with phosphorescent
clothing, and all had hair as flaming red as
Linnia&rsquo;s own.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Yes, Tata Moori looked like an exciting
place to visit, but it was not a visit Beth would
want to make without another person from her
own planet. As she thought about her predicament,
she began to be scared again and the
tears filled her eyes once more. Why, Sirius
was <i>trillions</i> of miles from Earth!</p>
<p>She went to the window. The dwindling
earth was becoming a green ball against the
black deeps of space. The stars were dazzling
and seemed as countless as the sands of the
seashore. The view made Beth terribly homesick.</p>
<p>Finally Linnia returned.</p>
<p>Beth looked at her anxiously, trying to read
her fate in the foreign girl&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did your father say?&rdquo; Beth asked,
with fluttering heart. &ldquo;Did he say he&rsquo;d take me
back? Please tell me he did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linnia smiled. &ldquo;Yes, Beth. He said that we
are not supposed to take younger persons to
Tata Moori. He was angry with me for not
telling him you were aboard, but I told him
you came in just before we blasted off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I&rsquo;m so relieved!&rdquo; Beth said happily.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean I wouldn&rsquo;t like your company,
Linnia, but you know how it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; Linnia replied wistfully. &ldquo;I
have missed my mother and friends too. I had
to take my brother&rsquo;s place on this trip when
he became sick. You see, everyone on Tata
Moori learns science when they are very
young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wondering how it is that you
speak English, Linnia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We keep tuned in on your radio and television,&rdquo;
Linnia answered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how we
learned your language and so many other
things about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You people seem to be ahead of us in
progress,&rdquo; Beth said. &ldquo;I believe there is much
we can learn from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can learn much from you too,&rdquo; Linnia
spoke. &ldquo;I hope the people of our planets are
permitted to meet very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>The girls had to belt down on their couches
again because of the mounting speed at which
they were returning to earth. Beth felt herself
sinking deeply into her cushion once more
and she grew breathless again. Minutes later,
the ship stopped moving.</p>
<p>Beth hurriedly unbuckled and ran over to
the window. Through a break in the <i>paloverde</i>
thicket she could see her father&rsquo;s station wagon
parked at the roadside. She was back at the
same place she had started from.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness!&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p>Linnia walked with her to the outer door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father said he&rsquo;d like to have met you,&rdquo;
Linnia said, &ldquo;but he is too busy preparing for
our blast off again. We must hurry because we
are behind schedule. Before you leave, Beth,
Father has said that you must promise never
to speak a word about all this to anyone. I
have searched your mind and I know you to
be honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beth was disappointed that she could not
make known her fabulous journey, but she
promised that she would never tell.</p>
<p>Linnia waved her hand at the door and the
electric eye opened it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Goodbye, Beth,&rdquo; Linnia said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodbye, Linnia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beth heard the sighing of the door as it
closed behind her.</p>
<p>Suddenly her head began aching and she remembered
the fall she had taken earlier. As
she made her way out of the thicket, she began
to have a queer feeling about her adventure.
It made her wonder if perhaps she might not
have been unconscious and imagined the
whole thing.</p>
<p>When she reached the car, her father said
with some concern, &ldquo;You were gone so long I
started to come for you, Beth. What happened
to your forehead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She told him about her fall but did not
mention the space ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see something land a few minutes
ago, Daddy?&rdquo; Beth asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Harrison grinned. &ldquo;You mean, maybe,
a Flying Saucer? No, I&rsquo;m afraid I didn&rsquo;t. Are
you sure your imagination isn&rsquo;t working overtime
again, Beth?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>As they were about to get into the car, Beth
saw a dark object in the distance rise from the
ground and move off into the deepening twilight.
She was certain she did not imagine this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw that, didn&rsquo;t you, Daddy?&rdquo; Beth
asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Harrison nodded. &ldquo;Probably a hawk.
Hmm, it looks like it&rsquo;s heading right for the
Evening Star, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beth gazed at the brilliant light of Sirius,
gorgeously bright now with darkness closing
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew if it really was,&rdquo; Beth murmured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="27" /></div><h2 id="c2"><br /><i>GIB TAKES A SPACE TEST</i></h2>
<p>Gib Bromfield was nine, and
the thing he wanted to do most was to make a
flight into space. A colony on the Moon had
already been started for scientific research, and
a huge man-made space platform circled the
Earth once every twenty-four hours.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want to go back to the Moon with you,
Father,&rdquo; Gib would plead every time Mr.
Bromfield came home on a furlough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re still a little young, Gib,&rdquo;
his father would reply. &ldquo;Some day you will be
able to go out into space with me, but not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bromfield was a construction engineer,
and he was helping to build a big spaceport on
the Moon. He came home to see his family
every six months. Each time he returned, Gib
couldn&rsquo;t wait to meet him at the front door of
their prefabricated home.</p>
<p>Gib would shake hands with him like a man
and take his bags from him. Then he would
step back and admire the tall, handsome man
in the glossy black boots and gray uniform of
the Space Service. By this time, Mother usually
came running up, followed by Sandra, Gib&rsquo;s
little sister.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>On Mr. Bromfield&rsquo;s latest visit, Gib waited
until the usual family talk had subsided before
he started asking his father about his recent
adventures. After Father had brought him
up to date, Gib asked the same question he always
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, my I go back with you this time for
a short visit&mdash;just a short one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bromfield smiled and rumpled Gib&rsquo;s
blond hair. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the time element, Gib,&rdquo;
he said patiently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the rigors of space itself,
which are much rougher than Captain
Rocket on TV would have us believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gib&rsquo;s face fell. He had hoped that this time
his father would give in and let him go back.
Mr. Bromfield could see that his son was disappointed.
He stared at Gib thoughtfully for
a moment, then spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Gib, I&rsquo;ll put you through S.Q.T.
If you pass it and still want to go spaceward,
I&rsquo;ll take you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, do you mean that?&rdquo; Gib burst out.</p>
<p>He was so excited he didn&rsquo;t know what to
do. Gib had never had any doubt that he would
pass the S.Q.T.&mdash;the Space Qualification Test&mdash;that
all those who go spaceward must take.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Mr. Bromfield went immediately to the
video-phone and put through a call to S.Q.T.,
having them place Gib&rsquo;s name on the space
test list.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Father!&rdquo; Gib said excitedly. &ldquo;At
last I&rsquo;ll be going spaceward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; Mr. Bromfield replied soberly.</p>
<p>Gib spent the next afternoon on the first
part of the test, which was a complete physical
examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t hurt the tiniest bit,&rdquo; Gib joked
with his father that night. &ldquo;If all the parts of
the test are as easy as this first one, I won&rsquo;t
have any trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bromfield did not say anything, but he
smiled to himself as though he knew something
that Gib did not know.</p>
<p>Gib and his father took the elevated expressway
to the S.Q.T. center early the next morning
in their atom-powered Johnson Superjet.
The final portions of Gib&rsquo;s test would be covered
today.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>The first part was familiarity with the space
suit. In company with about fifty other candidates,
Gib was given a supply of clothing.
Then everyone was shown how to zip up
their thickly insulated suits in front. Next, an
attendant snapped metal cylinders to their
shoulders and screwed the flexible tubing into
valves on their suits. Last to be put on were
helmets of light metal that had a darkened
glass in front so that the wearer could look
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, all of you turn the little black knob
on your chests,&rdquo; the tester said. His voice
sounded muffled to Gib because of the helmet
he wore.</p>
<p>Gib turned his knob and felt his suit blowing
up like a balloon as air flowed in from the
oxygen tanks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is how you would be dressed for a
walk on the Moon,&rdquo; the tester told them.
&ldquo;Now I want all of you to walk into the next
room.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>As Gib went into the room with the others,
he was thinking how easy the test had been up
until now. And what fun it was taking the very
tests that Captain Rocket himself must have
taken at one time! He thought his father was
surely mistaken for having doubted his ability
to pass the S.Q.T.</p>
<p>The tester left the room and shut the door.
In a few moments Gib began to have a strange
sensation. He was feeling lighter and lighter,
and the others with him were beginning to
float right off the floor!</p>
<p>Gib struggled frantically as he felt himself
go off balance. Each movement he made, however,
shot him off at swift, crazy angles. He
felt himself sweating with fear, and for the
first time he was believing that maybe the
S.Q.T. wasn&rsquo;t going to be so easy after all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>It seemed as if he had the strength of a
Samson, but it was a strength he could not
control. A simple kick sent him hurtling across
the room toward the wall! He tried to brake
himself, but nothing he did would stop him.
He crashed headlong into the wall. It shook
him up a little, but he was not hurt. He saw
that the wall was thickly padded.</p>
<p>After about fifteen minutes of helplessness,
Gib felt himself getting heavier again and saw
his companions drop to the floor in normal
position. The tester came in with some doctors.
The doctors looked over each candidate
and asked many questions. Gib was still dazed
and wasn&rsquo;t sure of the answers he gave.</p>
<p>When the doctors were through, the tester
explained what had happened: &ldquo;This room
was de-gravitized, which means the Earth&rsquo;s
gravity in here was cut off by mechanical
means. It&rsquo;s the same condition you will find
in a space ship when the gravity plates are
turned off. From the looks of some of you, this
experience was something of a shock. But the
final test will be even rougher. Anybody who
wants to drop out now may do so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Gib saw that about a third of the candidates
had had enough. Gib was still giddy himself
and started to join them. He was disappointed
in the harshness of &ldquo;zero-gravity.&rdquo; It had always
looked so simple to him the way that Captain
Rocket &ldquo;swam&rdquo; about in his rocket flyer.</p>
<p>Gib did not want his father to think him a
quitter, though, and decided to stick out the
test to the end. When his turn came, he was
led into a huge room by himself and up to a
queer-looking machine. It resembled one of
the thrill rides at a carnival, the one that whirls
you round and round like a ball on the end of
a string. Gib entered a tiny cabin at the end
of the large swinging arm and sat down in a
thick foam-rubber reclining chair.</p>
<p>As he was strapped down, the tester said to
him, &ldquo;This is called the &lsquo;Centrifuge,&rsquo; son, and
it simulates the blast-off from Earth in a rocket
ship. You appear to be a little young to be
taking it, so if you&rsquo;ve had enough just yank
that lever in front of you and we&rsquo;ll stop the
machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I will,&rdquo; Gib replied, getting scared already.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>He got more scared as all sorts of instruments
were strapped to him. The tester explained
that these were to record his reactions.
As the door was closed on him. Gib had a
trapped feeling. Then he composed himself
and waited for the worst, telling himself that a
spaceman must be brave.</p>
<p>Presently he felt the cabin begin to move,
slowly at first. This much was fun, Gib
thought, just like the carnival ride. As the
cabin picked up speed, it was even more thrilling.
But then as the speed increased still more,
Gib began to lose his enjoyment.</p>
<p>Faster and faster he went, and Gib was
crushed deeply into the chair cushion. He felt
his cheeks draw back from his teeth, the corners
of his eyes making him squint. There was
heavy pressure on his chest, as if an elephant
were standing on him. His breath hung in his
throat and he saw strange colors and darting
forms before his eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>He stood the agonizing effect as long as he
could, and then his frightfully heavy hand
crept unsteadily toward the lever in front of
him and jerked it.</p>
<p>The cabin began losing speed and finally
stopped. Gib saw a blurred image open the
door and offer his hand. As he stumbled out,
his head feeling big as a watermelon, Gib
vaguely remembered hearing the tester say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t feel badly about this, son. You
almost lasted it out. Come back in another
year or two and then I think you&rsquo;ll be able to
pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gib still wasn&rsquo;t quite himself as he met his
father in the waiting room. He was quivering
all over, and his dad wouldn&rsquo;t quite come into
focus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I flunked the test, Father,&rdquo; Gib told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds to me as if you&rsquo;re glad you did,&rdquo;
Mr. Bromfield replied, with a chuckle. &ldquo;I was
afraid it might be too rough for you, son, but
I knew there was no other way to show you
that space travel isn&rsquo;t as easy as the comic
books make out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try again next year,&rdquo; Gib said, &ldquo;or the
year after that, anyway. That&rsquo;s what the tester
told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be ready then,&rdquo; Mr. Bromfield
replied. &ldquo;Now, what do you say we go
home? Captain Rocket is almost due on TV.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="27" /></div><h2 id="c3"><br /><i>THE SPACE MAIL RUN</i></h2>
<p>The way he felt now, Jerry
Welsh was almost sorry he had left Earth. The
Moonship landing seemed to be crushing the
very life out of him, although he lay flat on a
couch to ease the strain.</p>
<p>Jerry turned his head toward his father, who
was strapped down like himself, and suffering
too. The craft was under its own control, for
no human could withstand the rocket&rsquo;s present
speed and still be able to steer in for a landing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Capt. Welsh was on his bi-weekly mail run
to Luna, the Moon, and for the first time in
ten years of service he had a passenger&mdash;his
own twelve-year-old son.</p>
<p>At last Jerry felt a hard jolt under him. He
knew the rocket&rsquo;s tail fins had finally touched
ground. Jerry unstrapped himself with rubbery
fingers and sat up. Then he tried to stand,
but flopped down again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow, I feel giddy!&rdquo; he groaned.</p>
<p>His father laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get your bearings
presently, Son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How long Jerry had waited to make this
space mail run with his father! Then finally
last year, Capt. Welsh had said that Jerry
could go with him when he became twelve,
as he was especially husky and strong for his
age.</p>
<p>But now that the great moment had come at
last, Jerry wasn&rsquo;t sure he was enjoying it as he
had expected, for he had found space so vast,
so dark, and so frightening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you still want to be a spaceman, Jerry?&rdquo;
his dad asked suddenly, as though Jerry had
spoken his thoughts aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I think so, Dad,&rdquo; he replied hesitantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re doubtful, Jerry,&rdquo; Capt. Welsh
said. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t put you on the spot so early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They climbed into space gear&mdash;electrically-heated
suits and clear plastic helmets fitted
with radios. Lastly they donned oxygen tanks
and flooded their suits with the life-sustaining
gas.</p>
<p>They gathered up the mail sacks and
climbed down the ladder to the ground, heading
for the largest of a group of buildings
which made up Moonhaven, center of Earthmen&rsquo;s
activity on the airless planet.</p>
<p>The stars burned fantastically bright overhead.
Traces of frost topped the distant Lunar
Alps. It was incredibly cold out here, for the
Moon was in its two-week period of night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Capt. Welsh got a receipt for the largest
mail bag, and then he and Jerry went out a
rear door of the building carrying the rest. An
atom-powered mail car awaited them. It had
an open top and huge wheels that looked like
saw-toothed gears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Climb aboard the Moon jeep, Jerry,&rdquo; his
father said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got ten mail deliveries to
make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inside, Capt. Welsh pulled down a section
of the dash panel revealing a map. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a
map of our route. There aren&rsquo;t many mail
stops on the Moon yet, but they are all important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the mail must go through!&rdquo; Jerry
added.</p>
<p>Capt. Welsh nodded soberly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
first law, Jerry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they moved off Jerry saw the big friendly
globe of Earth hanging like a green jewel halfway
up the jet black sky. He wondered what
his mother and baby sister were doing this moment
a quarter of a million miles away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Capt. Welsh showed Jerry how to run the
jeep. Jerry found this easy for he had already
had a course in mechanics in preparation for
his future career as a space man. But sometime
later their peaceful ride was interrupted
when Capt. Welsh suddenly leaned over and
grabbed the wheel.</p>
<p>Jerry was thrown to the side as the car
swerved. The vehicle straightened out and
slammed to a halt as his father controlled the
wheel and applied the brakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Jerry breathed, his
heart pounding.</p>
<p>His father pointed behind them. &ldquo;Look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry turned and saw the edge of a treacherous
ditch running right across the roadway
where they would have passed over. The gorge
was several feet wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even see it,&rdquo; Jerry murmured, sick
with fear at what might have happened.</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t the first time he&rsquo;d been shaken
on this journey. It made him wonder as he
had once before if he had what it took to be
a space man, or if this adventure would make
him decide never to leave the atmosphere of
Earth again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;Scared?&rdquo; his father asked. Jerry nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. I was too for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were?&rdquo; Jerry asked with surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear was given to man, so he could save
himself from danger, Jerry,&rdquo; Capt. Welsh
said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ashamed of it. Fear is nothing
to be ashamed of unless you let it get the best
of you. Never forget that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They arrived at their first delivery point, an
engineering project on a plateau surrounded
by mountains. There were the foundations of
great buildings to come, constructed of hard
Lunar granite.</p>
<p>The space-suited figures came running
when they recognized Capt. Welsh and his
mail car. Jerry marveled how the formerly
stern expressions of the workmen brightened
when the foreman handed mail out to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be fun bringing mail to men who
are so far from their homes and families,&rdquo;
Jerry said when they were on their way again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve put up with the
lonely hours of seeing nothing but stardust
for the past ten years,&rdquo; Capt. Welsh answered.
&ldquo;But I love it, Son, and I wouldn&rsquo;t trade jobs
with any man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their next delivery site was a cavern where
men were prospecting for uranium. They too
were overjoyed at receiving messages from
home. The jeep rolled on from there to a huge
plain which was being prepared for a future
spaceport. Capt. Welsh and his helper dropped
off another mail sack and then were on their
way again. Some hours later, all but two deliveries
had been made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next stop is the astronomy observatory,&rdquo;
Capt. Welsh told Jerry.</p>
<p>They crawled over sandy hills that taxed
the gripping power of their spiked wheels,
wound in and out of towering buttresses of
black basalt, and bored through natural tunnels
like a pair of human moles. Then the observatory
came into view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>A smiling little scientist with thick glasses
signed for the mail at the door. He invited
Jerry to come back and visit the place before
he returned to Earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen anything until you look
through their great telescope,&rdquo; Capt. Welsh
told Jerry as they drove off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s our last stop?&rdquo; Jerry wanted to
know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A geology camp where some scientists are
digging into ancient rocks,&rdquo; his father said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only about seven miles away, but the going
will be a little rough before we get there.
It&rsquo;s a good thing it&rsquo;s our last stop because we
don&rsquo;t have any too much oxygen left in our
shoulder tanks. I usually don&rsquo;t take this long
on a mail run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The roadway carried them through a narrow
pass with a high hill of loose rock on one
side and a sloping embankment on the other.
Jerry&rsquo;s first warning of trouble came when he
was flung suddenly forward. He heard the sickening
drag of the wheels as his father&rsquo;s boot
hit the brakes. Just ahead of them he saw a
cascade of rocks sliding down the hill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>The next moment Jerry felt an even harder
blow as the jeep was grazed by one of the large
boulders. The small car was swept out of the
roadway like a toy and rammed against a pillar
at the cliff edge.</p>
<p>Jerry screamed in fear as he felt himself being
thrown out of the car. He struck the
ground hard and began rolling head over heels
down the precipice.</p>
<p>When the numbing shock of his fall had
worn off, Jerry climbed dazedly to his feet and
looked up the slope down which he had been
thrown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; he cried. He slipped and scrambled
up the incline in reckless haste. He found
Capt. Welsh sprawled unconscious just below
the upper brink of the precipice. Jerry knelt
and looked into his face through the clear
plastic helmet. His father&rsquo;s eyes were closed
and there was an ugly bruise on his forehead
where it must have struck the helmet in his fall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;What am I going to do?&rdquo; Jerry groaned
aloud.</p>
<p>He himself would have to make the decisions
and carry them through if the two of
them were to survive. It was a shocking
thought. Then it came to him what his father
had said about fear: a person need never be
ashamed of fear so long as it was not permitted
to get the upper hand.</p>
<p>Jerry pulled his father up onto the roadway
and tried to bring him around, but without
result. Jerry examined the jeep. One side was
badly smashed, but the engine still appeared
sound. The car was tipped over against the
rock column. Jerry was thankful that the jeep
was only one-sixth of its Earth-weight on the
moon. It was a tremendous effort but he finally
righted the car and got it back on the road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>He jumped into the front seat and started
the engine. It sputtered, then hummed into
activity! Jerry studied the map on the panel.
He located their present position by the giant
crater, Plato, at his distant right. Then he
traced the winding route leading to the geology
camp. He was closer to the camp than the
observatory, but ahead lay a rugged route, one
with which Jerry was totally unfamiliar. He
got out and went back to where Capt. Welsh
lay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way should I go, Dad, ahead or
back?&rdquo; he asked helplessly, just as though his
father were able to answer him.</p>
<p>Something told him that Capt. Welsh would
want him to go ahead&mdash;to finish the mail run
that had never missed a round in ten years.
Jerry got his father into the back seat, then
gunned the jeep and struck off into the unknown
ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>He was thankful for the old worn trail that
led the way for him. It presently carried him
through a gloomy valley. Jerry switched on
his headlights, but the twin spears of brightness
gave him little comfort in the spooky
place. Grotesque rock columns rose like menacing
ghosts on both sides of him.</p>
<p>At last he was out in the open again. The
road led him around the steep ledge of a yawning
crater, evidently caused by a huge crashing
fireball from outer space.</p>
<p>Jerry carefully guided the jeep along the
dangerous cliff. If one of his wheels should
slip over the side, it would be a fall to frightful
death a hundred feet straight down. At
last even this peril was past, and Jerry drove
up a gradual incline over bare rock to a bluff
that overlooked the distant land for many
miles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The camp!&rdquo; he said joyfully. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it below&mdash;only
a few miles away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He followed a curve that swept onto the
plain below. When he was on a level again, it
seemed that all his troubles were over. He felt
better by the moment as he drove closer and
closer to his destination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Then, without warning, his wheels began
to bog down in a pumice mire. His heart did a
flip-flop and he checked the map. He saw a
warning to drivers to avoid this spot. In his
overconfidence, he had blundered right into
it!</p>
<p>He gave the little jeep full power. It jerked
crazily through the clinging stuff. Over to the
right the pumice seemed to thin out, and farther
over he could see the roadway he should
have taken. He swung his wheels to the right
and the jeep lurched through the gray sand,
using up a lot of power, but making little
progress. For minutes on end Jerry gave the
jeep all it had, and he could hear its engine
laboring tiredly.</p>
<p>Suddenly the motor died. Jerry tried to start
it again but could not. He checked his temperature
gauge. The engine was extremely hot
from the continual use of top power. From his
mechanical school course, Jerry realized the
rotors had &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; and that it wouldn&rsquo;t run
again until they had cooled off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>As he waited impatiently for the engine to
cool, a warning voice in his mind was saying:
&ldquo;Your oxygen is getting lower by the second.
If the jeep doesn&rsquo;t get out of here within the
next fifteen minutes, you and your dad will
never make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry shook off the terrible thoughts. He
stamped his feet to warm them. The electric
circuit in his suit seemed to be breaking down.
If it collapsed completely, he would be frozen
instantly by the Lunar cold.</p>
<p>Jerry massaged his dad&rsquo;s hands and legs
in case his suit, too, was getting colder. He
worked steadily until his hands ached. Then
he checked the gauge again. It was falling
slowly, but heavy insulation was still keeping
the engine hot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>At last Jerry decided he should not wait
any longer. With a prayer on his lips, he
pressed the starter button. The engine rumbled
sluggishly, coughed, then quickened to
full strength. He jammed the fuel pedal hard
and tried to guide the jeep&rsquo;s swirling, spinning
motion through the Lunar sand. Slowly the
little car pulled itself like a weary swimmer
toward the firm bank. Finally the wheels
found good traction and the jeep lurched onto
the roadway.</p>
<p>Jerry heaved a tremendous sigh and sped
down the path toward the geology camp.</p>
<p>Less than an hour later Jerry was being permitted
into the room of one of the huts where
his father had been carried for examination
by the camp physician. Jerry had been told
that his father had suffered a slight concussion,
but that he would be all right.</p>
<p>Capt. Welsh smiled from his cot as Jerry
walked in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, space man,&rdquo; his father greeted. &ldquo;The
doctor says the men here were mighty happy
to get their mail on time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I came on here, then, instead of
going back to the observatory,&rdquo; Jerry murmured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;You did the job in the best tradition of the
Space Mail Service, Jerry,&rdquo; Capt. Welsh said,
smiling proudly. &ldquo;If I had any doubts that
you&rsquo;d be able to follow me some day, Son,
they&rsquo;re gone now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry nodded happily. A few doubts had
been removed from his own mind in the past
hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="27" /></div><h2 id="c4"><br /><i>ALL ABOARD FOR SPACE</i></h2>
<p>It had already been a wonderful
birthday for the twins, Sue and Steve Shannon,
when their father asked, &ldquo;How about it, kids&mdash;are
you ready for that space ride I promised?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Sue&rsquo;s big hazel eyes looked like walnuts as
she stared in surprise. Steve&rsquo;s blue eyes were
more like plums. Could they really believe
what they were hearing?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said I&rsquo;d take you on the ride when you
two reached 12, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Mr. Shannon went
on.</p>
<p>They hadn&rsquo;t forgotten and were suddenly
as excited as two young ducks who have just
discovered water. Mr. Shannon looked at his
watch. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better get ready. The next flight
is at four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Less than a half hour later, Mrs. Shannon
was bidding goodbye to the three as they
climbed into the family helicopter on the roof
of their home. In this year of 2004 nearly
everybody owned a &rsquo;copter. Mrs. Shannon had
been invited to go along but she said no coaxing
in the world could get her up in one of
those &ldquo;rocket things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The overhead doors of the garage swung
open as Mrs. Shannon pushed the button on
the wall. As soon as the three riders were comfortably
seated, Mr. Shannon started up the
engine and the overhead blade began churning.
Gently the &rsquo;copter lifted into the blue
sky and headed out over the city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t really believe we&rsquo;re going to take
a trip into space!&rdquo; Sue said happily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day I&rsquo;m going to be a spaceman and
travel to <i>all</i> the planets!&rdquo; Steve declared.</p>
<p>The plane passed over beautiful triple-decked
highways, over green farms loaded
with scientific equipment and solar mirrors,
over plastic-domed skyscrapers. Presently a
large oval appeared just ahead. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the
space port!&rdquo; Sue exclaimed.</p>
<p>When Mr. Shannon got the signal to land,
he brought the helicopter down into the parking
lot at the edge of the port. Then the three
jumped out onto the ground. As they walked
toward the main building, the twins excitedly
noticed the busy activity of the field. What impressed
them most were the massive torpedo-shaped
rockets which were half-buried in their
concrete launching pits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is that biggest rocket going, Dad?&rdquo;
Steve asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>When his father said it was going to the
moon, a tingle raced up the boy&rsquo;s spine and
all at once he wished he could be on the ship
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s our rocket over there,&rdquo; Mr. Shannon
said, pointing to a smaller craft of light-weight
beryllium metal just across the way.
Near the pit was a sign that read:</p>
<p class="center">SPACE RIDES DAILY.
<br />ENJOY THE THRILL OF A LIFETIME A THOUSAND MILES ABOVE EARTH.</p>
<p>Mr. Shannon got their tickets. Then after
a heart check-up they waited in line with the
other eager sight-seers. Finally the space port
officer took down the chain that held back the
crowd and permitted them to approach the
rocket. They had to cross a bridge to get from
the pit edge into the ship. As they crossed,
Steve looked down into the hot pit and saw
clouds of flame and smoke pouring from the
great jet tubes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>In the ship, the Shannons were given couch
numbers in a large room with the rest of their
companions. Then a steward came around
with a special candy which he told the passengers
to eat to prevent their getting sick. Next
everyone was issued queer-looking shoes with
metal soles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re these for, Dad?&rdquo; Sue wanted to
know.</p>
<p>She saw her father and brother exchange
winks. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll find out, won&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Mr. Shannon
teased.</p>
<p>As Steve and Sue lay on their soft couches
and fastened plastic belts across their bodies,
their father explained the purpose of this.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll blast-off at a pretty fast speed and if we
weren&rsquo;t buckled down we&rsquo;d be thrown about
and hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>When the moment of blast-off came, Steve
and Sue went through the most exciting experience
of their lives. A loud roar filled their
ears and it felt suddenly as if the bottom of
their stomachs had dropped out. They were
pressed deeply into their couches and they had
the feeling of being flattened out as though
under the foot of an elephant. Then slowly
Steve and Sue felt the awful weight lifting
from them and finally it was gone altogether.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; Sue groaned dizzily, unstrapping
herself as the others were doing. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she tried to walk, she understood the
purpose of the metal-soled shoes. &ldquo;We scarcely
weigh anything now,&rdquo; their father explained.
&ldquo;The magnetism of our soles is the only thing
that keeps us from floating about like a
feather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide, who said his name was Mr.
Quinlan, led the sight-seers to a huge window.
The young Shannons gasped in wonder at
what they saw. The sky was nearly pitch black
and filled with more burning lights than they
even guessed could exist.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re about a thousand miles above the
earth,&rdquo; Mr. Quinlan said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re out of the
earth&rsquo;s atmosphere and that&rsquo;s why the sky is
dark and the stars so brilliant. Our rear jets
are thrusting just barely enough to keep us
from being pulled back down to earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide next said that they would go outside
the ship in space suits. Sue and Steve
whooped in joy for they had not expected this.
Mr. Quinlan distributed space gear from a
cabinet. Then he explained how they were
put on. After the flexible suits and plastic helmets
were donned, everyone turned on his
oxygen, which came from shoulder tanks. The
others looked to Steve like balloon toys inflated
with air and he had to laugh as they
waddled about.</p>
<p>The tourists were led out of a side door onto
a balcony which resembled a large fire escape.
Everyone was told to buckle himself to the rail
by a short length of cord in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If one of us were to lose contact with the
ship,&rdquo; Mr. Shannon warned his son and daughter,
&ldquo;he&rsquo;d go drifting off into space.&rdquo; Sue and
Steve shuddered at the thought of this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<div class="img" id="pic2">

<p class="caption"><i>Everyone was told to buckle himself to the rail by a short length of cord</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Mr. Quinlan pointed out whirls of misty
clouds that were called nebulas. He also
showed them star clusters and the brighter
planets. The sight-seers had a closeup view of
the earth that looked like a shimmering green
ball. The guide did his speaking through a
small radio attached to his suit. Each tourist
had a receiver in his helmet through which he
could listen.</p>
<p>For almost a full hour Sue and Steve, together
with the other spell-bound passengers,
took in the splendor of this strange silent place,
the vastness of which staggered the imagination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this a wonderful tribute to the greatness
of God&rsquo;s creation?&rdquo; Mr. Shannon said to
his children. Steve and Sue had to agree with
him wholeheartedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>When Mr. Quinlan was ready to go back
into the ship, he tried the outside door switch,
but the door failed to open. Over his two-way
radio circuit, the passengers could hear a worried
discussion between him and the pilot
inside. They learned that a tube of compressed
air which operated the outer door was
jammed. There was nothing that could be
done about it from the inside. Some of the
women began sobbing, believing they would
never return to earth again.</p>
<p>Mr. Shannon looked at his son and daughter
anxiously. &ldquo;Keep your chins up, kids,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Nothing was ever gained by people losing
their heads. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll figure out
some way to save us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m not afraid, Dad,&rdquo; Steve said bravely.</p>
<p>There were tears of fright in Sue&rsquo;s brown
eyes but her small chin was courageously set
and she would not permit herself to give in to
the terror she really felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re brave ones,&rdquo; their father said, putting
his big arms around their shoulders.</p>
<p>Mr. Quinlan approached the Shannons.
&ldquo;Mr. Shannon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something
important to talk over with you and your son.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>The two listened closely as the guide outlined
a daring plan. He pointed to a small,
circular opening some ten feet above the platform.
He said that if a person could climb
into the opening he could turn an emergency
valve that would double the air pressure and
clear the jammed tube. Since Steve was the
only boy on the platform, and therefore the
smallest, Mr. Quinlan wanted to know if Steve
would try it. Steve felt his heart fluttering
crazily. He was both afraid and excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one danger, son,&rdquo; the guide
pointed out. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to unfasten your
safety line. If you think you can keep calm,
though, there should be no real risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will happen if the job isn&rsquo;t done?&rdquo;
Mr. Shannon asked grimly.</p>
<p>Mr. Quinlan shrugged. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much
that can be done. These suits will run out of
oxygen in twenty minutes and only your boy
is slim enough to get inside the opening.
Then, too, they can&rsquo;t land the ship without the
risk of tossing us all out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Mr. Shannon said quietly to Steve, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s up
to you, son. If you believe you can go through
with it without losing your head and getting
thrown from the ship....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve swallowed hard, thinking of the lives
of the others around him that depended upon
him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try it,&rdquo; he managed to say.</p>
<p>He felt his knees go weak when the safety
rope was unfastened from his waist and he
realized there was nothing now but his magnetic
shoes to hold him to the ship. Carefully
Mr. Quinlan boosted him up toward the opening
above. <i>Tick-tick-tick</i> went his metal soles
against the shiny skin of the craft as he made
his way upward by means of special climbing
handles on the rocket hull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep calm,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;A spaceman
doesn&rsquo;t lose his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was thankful for the firm grip of his
gloves as his fingers closed about the sides of
the chamber and he pulled himself up inside.
It was a close fit even for him. Mr. Quinlan
had told him that usually the emergency valve
was easily reached from the deck above but
that during this trip the deck was closed off
for repairs and couldn&rsquo;t be entered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>Steve found the valve handle and turned it
as he was instructed. Almost immediately he
heard the deafening blast of many voices in his
receiver. Among the words he heard were,
&ldquo;The door&rsquo;s opening!&rdquo; Steve sighed deeply
and carefully started down again.</p>
<p>But the danger was not over yet. He still
had to be very cautious. This was brought to
him sickeningly when he drew his foot back
with greater force than usual and found himself
weaving backward into space. With a chill
of terror he grabbed a climbing handle and
pulled himself snug against the ship&rsquo;s hull
again. Finally he felt the strong arms of his
father on the lower part of his legs. He relaxed
and was helped down onto the platform amid
the cheers of everyone around.</p>
<p>The sight-seers, sobered by their close call,
trooped silently back into the ship. A moment
later the craft began dropping earthward, its
jets acting as brakes to check the rapid descent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>After landing, the Shannons were called
into the office of the Chief of Operations at
the space port.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; the chief said to Steve, &ldquo;let
me congratulate you for the brave thing you
did.&rdquo; He offered his hand and Steve felt a
flush of pride as he took the big palm in his
own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such an unselfish deed can never be fully
repaid,&rdquo; the chief went on. &ldquo;Tell me, Steve,
do you like space-going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve&rsquo;s eyes glowed with stars. &ldquo;Very much,
sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Some day I&rsquo;m going to become
a spaceman myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then this little reward we have for you
and your sister may help you reach your goal.&rdquo;
He held out a plastic-sealed card. Steve took it
as his heart raced. It was a lifetime rocket pass!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="27" /></div><h2 id="c5"><br /><i>WHEEL IN THE SKY</i></h2>
<p>Sue and Steve Shannon were
riding with their father in a &ldquo;space ferry&rdquo; several
thousand miles above the Earth. They
could look out of the plastic windows of the
little ship and see the winding curve of Central
America far below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Steve!&rdquo; Sue exclaimed. &ldquo;I see the
Panama Canal!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a storm over the Gulf of Mexico,&rdquo;
Steve said, studying a big gray patch over the
water. &ldquo;It makes you feel like a king being so
high above everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Atlantic and Pacific were throbbing
blue carpets, topped by breakers of molten
silver where the sunlight hit them. It was a
marvelous sight, more like a scene from a fairy-land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the big space ship we got off,&rdquo;
Sue pointed out. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beginning to drop back
to Earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Wheel in the Sky,&rsquo;&rdquo; Steve
said, looking ahead. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon be there! Isn&rsquo;t
it great?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Compared to the tiny ship they were in,
which was shaped like a medicine capsule, the
Wheel in the Sky was a gigantic thing. It
looked like an automobile wheel and by its
moving spokes the children saw that it was
turning just like one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does the Wheel spin, Dad?&rdquo; Steve
asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s in order to give the people inside
of it a feeling of weight,&rdquo; Mr. Shannon explained.
&ldquo;As I told you before, things in space
have no weight because there is no gravity out
here to speak of. What happens when you ride
on the merry-go-round on the school playground?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have to hold on tight or it&rsquo;ll throw you
off,&rdquo; Steve answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Wheel in the Sky does the same thing.
It tries to throw you off, but since you are
safely inside of it, all it can do is throw your
weight against the floor of the Wheel. Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children nodded and smiled, pleased
at knowing one more fact about the strange
ways of space.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>As the ferry neared the big space station,
Steve watched the black heavens all around
them. The stars were thicker than salt crystals
and glittered like precious gems. Close to the
Wheel, the ferry had to use its rockets in order
to keep up with the spinning of the Wheel.
Presently a door in the rim of the Wheel
opened. Two men in space suits appeared in
the doorway and threw out a line which stuck
to the ferry by magnetism. Then the men
pulled the little ship inside and closed the
doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are!&rdquo; the ferry pilot called to his
passengers. &ldquo;Everybody out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since there was fresh air in the hangar, the
riders did not have to use space suits. Just as
his father had said, Steve found that he could
walk around as easily as he did back in Arkansas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready for a tour of the Wheel, kids?&rdquo; Mr.
Shannon asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; the twins replied together.</p>
<p>Mr. Shannon worked for the American
Space Supply Company which carried supplies
to the planets of the Solar System. This was
the year 2004 and by now nearly all the planets
or their moons had budding Earth colonies.
Sue and Steve had earned free lifetime space
passes because of a heroic act Steve had done
a month before on the twins&rsquo; very first trip
into space.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>As Mr. Shannon took the two around the
&ldquo;man-made moon,&rdquo; they were almost overcome
by all the wonderful things they saw.
They learned that the Wheel in the Sky was
both a scientific laboratory and a military lookout.
With their big telescopes, the Space
Guard could see every mile of Earth, for the
Wheel circled the globe several times a day.</p>
<p>While the Shannons were in the Military
Lookout Room peering at the world through
a telescope, Sue said, &ldquo;I wish Mom could be
here with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, too, Sis,&rdquo; Steve replied. &ldquo;But it would
take all the soldiers in the Humpty-Dumpty
story to get Mom into a rocket, wouldn&rsquo;t it,
Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Shannon chuckled. &ldquo;I believe it would,
Son.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Their father leaned over and whispered
something to the officer at the telescope, who
nodded. The man slipped a high power lens
on the telescope and turned it on a certain
part of the United States, toward which the
Wheel was slowly moving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take another look, Sue,&rdquo; her father said.</p>
<p>Sue eagerly went to the eyepiece. The telescope
brought a city into very close range. It
seemed as if she had only to reach out a finger
to touch the tall spire of a building. Suddenly
she gasped. She knew that building! It was the
home office of her father&rsquo;s place of work. The
city was Little Rock, Arkansas, their own
home!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steve, look!&rdquo; she said excitedly to her
brother and let him see for himself.</p>
<p>Steve was as thrilled as Sue. Together they
moved the telescope lens over all the familiar
spots of the great space city, which in this day
had a million population. They were able to
locate the wee speck that was their own home
in the suburbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can almost see Mom hanging out the
wash in the yard!&rdquo; Steve said with a grin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Before the children were through looking,
they noticed several black hazy spots in different
parts of the state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are these, Dad?&rdquo; Steve asked, showing
them to his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re tornadoes, Son,&rdquo; Mr. Shannon replied.
&ldquo;There seems to be an unusually large
crop of them this season. There are even some
close to Little Rock. The Weather Control
Bureau here has a way of dealing with them,
though. They do many skillful things in
Weather Control. They can make it rain in
dry parts of the world and even melt snow
drifts in blizzard areas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can they do about a tornado?&rdquo; Steve
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When one threatens a city they fire a
guided missile&mdash;a bomb&mdash;that breaks up the
twister before it can do any harm. We&rsquo;ll visit
the Weather Control Bureau as soon as we&rsquo;ve
been to the hub of the Wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>Mr. Shannon led them out of the Military
Lookout Room. Steve and Sue then found a
job of climbing facing them. In order to reach
the hub, they had to go through one of the
spokes leading into the center of the Wheel.
The children saw before them a nylon ladder
stretching as far as they could see down a long
corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start climbing,&rdquo; their father said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we just walk along the hall,&rdquo;
Sue asked, &ldquo;instead of doing it the hard way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re forgetting that the Wheel is always
throwing you outward as it spins,&rdquo; Mr. Shannon
said. &ldquo;If you tried to walk down the spoke
it would be like trying to walk against a hurricane.
For this reason, you two must be careful
not to lose your grip on the ladder or you&rsquo;ll
be flung down the corridor against the rim.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>The three began climbing hand over hand
along the ladder. They got along very well until
Sue suddenly became dizzy and lost her
hold. She screamed as she began flying down
the corridor. Steve&rsquo;s heart nearly stopped beating
for a moment. He heard his father calling
out loudly in a frantic voice: &ldquo;Grab the ladder,
Sue! Grab the ladder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first Sue did not seem to hear and kept
hollering in fright. Then she understood and
reached out wildly with her hands for the nylon
ladder as she swept along. One hand seized
a piece of it and she held on for dear life, her
body still hanging in mid-air as the force of
the turning Wheel kept trying to throw her
outward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, Sue!&rdquo; her father called. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He and Steve swiftly crawled along the
ladder to the spot where Sue was clinging with
one hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hang on much
longer!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>Just as she was about to let go, Steve reached
her and held on to her with his free hand.
Then his father lent his help and Sue was safe.
She sobbed for a moment from the fright she
had had and Mr. Shannon suggested that they
go back to the rim where they would be safe
again. Both children agreed, for they had suddenly
lost all interest in the hub.</p>
<p>By the time they got to the Weather Control
Bureau they found more worry awaiting
them. Men were hustling about the huge room
with serious looks on their faces. One of them
was looking into the eyepiece of a large machine
that was pointed out the window down
onto Earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Mr. Shannon asked one
of the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tornado is headed for Little Rock, Arkansas!&rdquo;
was the shocking reply. &ldquo;I hope our
missile scores a hit, but it isn&rsquo;t going to be easy
because the Wheel has already moved past the
United States!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The missile&rsquo;s <i>got</i> to hit!&rdquo; Steve burst out.
&ldquo;Our home and Mom are there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s simply <i>got</i> to!&rdquo; Sue added tearfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>The Shannons had to stand helplessly on
the side as the tornado fighters went to work.
The missile gun was in another part of the
Wheel, but the orders for firing it would leave
this room by radio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, why couldn&rsquo;t Mom have come with
us?&rdquo; Sue asked. &ldquo;She would have been safe
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve felt his whole body tensing like a
wound spring. The perspiration was beading
his forehead and his knees were weak. On his
father&rsquo;s face there was a dark look and Steve
saw that his big hands were opening and closing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty seconds to go before firing,&rdquo; the
man at the machine said slowly over the radio
mike on his chest. &ldquo;Steady. Eighteen&mdash;seventeen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they hurry?&rdquo; Sue cried.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re so slow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have to do it a certain way,&rdquo; Mr.
Shannon answered. &ldquo;They know what they&rsquo;re
doing, Honey. Don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>But she <i>was</i> afraid. And so was Steve. And
her father, too. Everyone in the room was
afraid because no one could say whether the
tornado could be destroyed before it hit the
city or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight&mdash;seven&mdash;six&mdash;&rdquo; droned the unhurried
voice of the operator.</p>
<p>The Shannons hardly dared breathe for
fear of disturbing the man at the machine.
Steve felt Sue&rsquo;s body quivering next to him. It
seemed as if the seconds were dragging on endlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three&mdash;two&mdash;one&mdash;FIRE!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve felt nothing but he knew the tornado
bomb was on its way, speeding hundreds of
miles a second Earthward.</p>
<p>For long, awfully long, moments after the
operator had said, &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; the Shannons waited
for him to speak again. He kept looking
calmly through the eyepiece of the machine as
though just studying the stars. Then at last
they saw a smile spread over his face and he
said to everyone in the room, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hit! Little
Rock is safe!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>

<p class="caption"><i>The tornado bomb was on its way, speeding hundreds of miles a second Earthward</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Sue and Steve whooped as if it were Christmas
morning. Where a minute before they
had been greatly worried, now they were
happy as they never believed they could be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; Mr. Shannon sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
I&rsquo;ve had enough excitement to last me a lifetime!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me, Dad,&rdquo; Steve said, as the fire of
adventure began to glow again in his eyes. &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t be satisfied until I&rsquo;ve seen what lies
beyond the Wheel in the Sky!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="27" /></div><h2 id="c6"><br /><i>DANGER ON THE ICE CANAL</i></h2>
<p>Steve and Sue Shannon were at
Mars Port No. 13. This was one of the many
colonies on the planet Mars where Earth
scientists were carrying on work. It was a town
of plastic tops, called domes, that were clear
as glass. The town was at the center of three
canals that led outward into the red desert.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>The Shannon twins were now touring the
largest dome with Biff Warren, who worked
for their father&rsquo;s space cargo company. Suddenly
their tour brought them to a large cafeteria
where many of the workers were eating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umm!&rdquo; Sue exclaimed. &ldquo;Smell that turkey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; Steve said. &ldquo;It sure makes your
mouth water, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which reminds me,&rdquo; Biff said, looking at
his watch. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to finish up our sightseeing
pretty soon. The quicker we get back to
your father&rsquo;s ship, the quicker we can have
our own turkey feast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hardly wait for that!&rdquo; Sue sighed, as
the wonderful smell of the holiday meal kept
tickling her nose.</p>
<p>When Thanksgiving dinner was finished
aboard the big space freighter that had brought
the children to Mars, the ship would take off
into space. But before that, Biff, Sue and Steve
would have to go twenty miles back down the
ice canal to reach the ship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>Biff had become a close friend of the young
Shannons, having made trips with them to
other ports in space. Sue liked Biff because of
his quick smile and gentle patience. Steve
liked him because he was all that Steve would
like to be some day himself&mdash;a fearless, bold
spaceman.</p>
<p>They finished up their tour of the dome.
They saw the room where giant machines
made oxygen out of chemicals and blew it
through the building so that there was fresh
air to breathe all the time. And they saw the
astronomy hall far up on top of the dome
where scientists could see the heavens through
the thin atmosphere much clearer than they
could from Earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it about time for the fuel rocket to
be shot off, Biff?&rdquo; Steve asked.</p>
<p>Biff nodded. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s just about time,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll suit up and go outside to see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>In the dressing room they put on their space
suits. As though they were his own children,
Biff carefully checked the young Shannons&rsquo; air
tanks, built-in heaters, and their helmet radios
for talking to one another. Finally Biff rubbed
gelatin on their helmets so that they would
not frost over in the cold that was a hundred
degrees below zero.</p>
<p>Outside they found space-suited figures
gathered around the fuel rocket cannon. The
cannon was pointed toward a shiny ball high
up in the purple-black sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Sis, there&rsquo;s the space ship toward
which they&rsquo;re going to shoot the fuel rocket,&rdquo;
Steve said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it!&rdquo; Sue cried, her eyes dancing excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have to line up the cannon with the
ship just right or the rocket won&rsquo;t reach it,&rdquo;
Biff said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the rocket hit the ship?&rdquo; Steve asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;ll lose all its speed by the time it
reaches the ship,&rdquo; Biff told him. &ldquo;Then they&rsquo;ll
take on fuel from the rocket by means of a
long hose.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Suddenly the three of them heard a loud
roar and saw a burst of flame. Like a bullet,
the rocket left the muzzle of the giant gun and
rose into the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be shooting off more rockets before
they have enough fuel for the space ship,&rdquo; Biff
said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a little wait in between each
firing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Biff, isn&rsquo;t the space ship right over
the canal where we&rsquo;ll be heading back?&rdquo; Steve
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Steve,&rdquo; Biff answered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
remember, our ship is at the end of the canal.
We&rsquo;ll be able to see the rockets go off as we
head back&mdash;which we&rsquo;d better do right now, if
we&rsquo;re going to have any turkey and pumpkin
pie!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>The canals of Mars had been carved out of
a great desert by water and fierce winds. Because
of the ice that filled them, they made
good highways. The three went to the canal
bank to see if their sled was ready to go, and
it was. The sled looked like a big bombing
plane with the wings off. Instead of wheels,
there were long runners beneath it. In this
sled Biff and his young helpers had brought
supplies to the colony several hours before.</p>
<p>Steve, Sue and Biff climbed into the front
seat. Then Biff shut the door. He pushed buttons
in front of them. Steve and Sue felt the
sled&rsquo;s engines throbbing. The next moment
the sled shot off over the smooth sheet of ice,
Biff holding tightly to the steering wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wheeeeee!&rdquo; Sue screamed in delight.
&ldquo;Offffffffff weeeeeeee goooooooooo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a rooooller cooooster!&rdquo; Steve shouted.</p>
<p>They sped along at a hundred miles an hour.
This was as much fun as they had had on their
last space journey.</p>
<p>Each of their trips into space seemed to be
more exciting than the last. They had won a
lifetime free pass into space and by now they
were sure they would need a lifetime in which
to see all of its many wonders. A brave act by
Steve on their first space trip had earned them
their pass. Right now, Steve thought that their
mother and home, back in Arkansas, seemed
as far away as Deneb, the North Star of Mars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be there in about ten minutes,&rdquo; Biff
said. &ldquo;The ship leaves in thirty, which gives
us some spare time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; Sue said, &ldquo;there comes the first fuel
rocket back down in a parachute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Sue,&rdquo; Biff replied.</p>
<p>Steve studied the bank of the canal. Along it
he saw scrubby cactus, which was forever fighting
for life in the cold, dry atmosphere. Beyond
the bank stretched acres of red wasteland,
and sand drifts piled up by strong winds that
never stopped blowing.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Sue noticed a bright
streak against the purple sky. It was nearly as
bright as the tiny sun, which was so far away
that it could not keep Mars warm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There goes another fuel rocket!&rdquo; Sue
called out, pointing through the windshield.</p>
<p>As Biff caught sight of it, he jerked up
sharply in his seat, bumping the shoulders of
Sue and Steve on both sides of him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;That rocket&rsquo;s too low!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not lifting! Something&rsquo;s gone wrong!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve felt chills run up his spine. He was
seeing the danger too, now. The rocket was
dropping ahead of them, a screaming bomb
filled with explosive fuel. It was still quite a
distance away, but even Steve knew that it
would make a terrible blast when it struck the
ice.</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s feet hit the brakes of the sled and the
runners chewed into the hard ice pack, shrieking,
and bringing the sled to a skidding stop.
The riders were slammed forward. Sue and
Steve were dazed, but not hurt. When Steve&rsquo;s
mind cleared, he saw that Biff had thrown himself
over in front of Sue and him to protect
them. But in doing this, his helmet had
thumped against the windshield. He was now
slumped over and not moving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sue!&rdquo; Steve cried. &ldquo;Biff is hurt!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Just then they felt the shock of the explosion.
It tilted the sled at an angle and dropped
it down again with a hard jolt. The air was
filled with flying chunks of ice. It looked like
a hailstorm outside. The ice clattered against
the windshield like stones. Sue and Steve were
relieved when it finally stopped. But the explosion
had left the ice sheet in front of them
broken and choked with lumps of ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steve,&rdquo; Sue moaned, &ldquo;what are we going
to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve looked at Biff who was still not moving.
He could see a big lump on Biff&rsquo;s forehead
where his head had struck the helmet,
knocking him out. The children tried to revive
their friend, but could not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get the sled to the ship ourselves,
Sue!&rdquo; her brother said. &ldquo;Biff may need
a doctor! Besides, I bet we&rsquo;ve all missed our
Thanksgiving dinner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t want any dinner if Biff is hurt
badly!&rdquo; Sue said tearfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>At first it seemed like an impossible thing
for a pair of twelve-year-olds to run the big
sled. But Steve remembered how Biff had
worked the controls and he believed he, too,
could do it. He changed seats with the unconscious
spaceman and tried the levers and
buttons.</p>
<p>Presently the sled&rsquo;s rockets began to pour
fire out of the rear. But Steve couldn&rsquo;t get the
sled to move. He was afraid it had been damaged.
Then Sue showed him a lever to push
which she had remembered seeing Biff shove.
As Steve worked it gently, the sled started off
slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go slow,&rdquo; Steve said, &ldquo;and take it
very easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The explosion had hit at the far edge of the
canal so that there was a narrow place on the
other side where the ice was still smooth. Steve
carefully guided the sled across the canal and
through the unbroken part. When there was
smooth ice before them, Steve picked up speed
a little. As he drove, Sue tried to awaken Biff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Steve would have found their adventure a
lot of fun if things weren&rsquo;t so serious at the moment.
It wasn&rsquo;t every day that a boy had the
chance to drive a giant rocket sled on a distant
planet!</p>
<p>At last Steve saw the round top of the space
ship just over the horizon. It was at that moment
that Sue called out the good news:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biff&rsquo;s awakening, Steve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy saw their friend slowly rise up,
then shake his head to clear it. When he
smiled at them in his pleasant way, they were
sure that he was going to be all right. By the
time they had told him what had happened,
he was his old self again. He took the controls
and looked at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time&rsquo;s running out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
to hit top speed again. Hold onto your helmets!
Here we go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And off they went at lightning speed once
more. It seemed to Steve as if they covered
the distance between them and the space ship
in seconds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>As the sled came to a gentle stop beneath
the giant freighter, Biff said, &ldquo;It looks like we&rsquo;ll
make our Thanksgiving dinner on time after
all, doesn&rsquo;t it, kids?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Steve answered, &ldquo;and this is certainly
one Thanksgiving that I&rsquo;m really thankful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean, Steve,&rdquo; Sue said
thoughtfully. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re thankful that we&rsquo;re
alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff and Steve both nodded. It was a holiday
none of them would ever forget.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="27" /></div><h2 id="c7"><br /><i>CARGO FOR CALLISTO</i></h2>
<p>The big rocket freighter was
speeding through the star dust of outer space.
It was carrying supplies to Callisto (one of the
twelve moons of Jupiter) and the Shannons,
on another space adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Steve and Sue looked out a window of the
freighter at the airless world growing in size.
Callisto was a gigantic roughened rock, but it
was a globe larger than the planet Mercury.
It reminded Steve of a giant cockle-burr hanging
in the sky.</p>
<p>Suddenly the children heard a tiny voice
behind them say, &ldquo;Rocket away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned and Sue exclaimed, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Bud!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blue parakeet, a budgy, blinked lazily
at them. The twins had met Mr. Whittle&rsquo;s
pet a week ago. He had taken a liking to them
from the very start. They didn&rsquo;t know that a
few hours from now their very lives would depend
on this little fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better take him back to Mr. Whittle,&rdquo;
Steve said.</p>
<p>The budgy kept studying them with his flat
face and blinking his tiny button eyes. Then
he squawked again, &ldquo;Rocket away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be &lsquo;rocket away&rsquo; for you, young fellow!&rdquo;
Steve said sternly. &ldquo;Up on my finger,
Bud!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>The bird did as he was ordered. They took
him down the hall to Mr. Whittle&rsquo;s room.
Bud&rsquo;s owner, off duty now, was a tall, spidery
crewman with a big Adam&rsquo;s apple. He always
gave his pet full run of the ship.</p>
<p>Mr. Whittle whistled to the parakeet, but
the bird stayed on Steve&rsquo;s finger.</p>
<p>Mr. Whittle chuckled. &ldquo;Hey, I believe he
likes you two better than his master!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We like him, too,&rdquo; Sue told the crewman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can keep him for a few days if you
want to,&rdquo; Mr. Whittle said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be
pretty busy after we land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, we&rsquo;d like to look after him!&rdquo; Steve
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you take him outside on Callisto, you&rsquo;ll
have to put him in that air-tight cage over
there I had made. It&rsquo;s sort of like a space suit
for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sue and Steve played with Bud in the room
they used for games until it was time to &ldquo;strap
down&rdquo; for landing. Then they went to the
couch hall and lay down on cots like the other
space travelers were doing. They buckled
straps across their bodies to keep them in
place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>For a long time, Steve and Sue lay there as
the big freighter began cutting its rushing
speed. It felt to Steve as if a giant anvil were
crushing downward on his chest. Take-off and
landing were always the roughest moments in
space travel, as the twins had already found
out on other space trips.</p>
<p>At last the ship set down on Callisto. The
young Shannons went back to the game room.
Then with the bird on Steve&rsquo;s shoulder, the
twins looked out the window at the strange
new world.</p>
<p>They saw a land bathed in ghostly twilight.
Very little light was coming from the sun. It
was so far away that it was only a small circle.
Most of the light came from a huge shape that
looked like somebody&rsquo;s lost beach ball resting
on the ground. Its bottom edge just touched
the horizon.</p>
<p>Sue and Steve were joined by their father,
who worked for the space freight company.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s His Majesty, Jupiter&mdash;the king of
planets,&rdquo; Mr. Shannon told them. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s over
a million miles away and yet he looks close
enough to touch, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go outdoors, Dad!&rdquo; Steve begged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No reason why we can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mr. Shannon
replied.</p>
<p>After they had put on their space clothes,
Steve popped Bud into his warm, air-tight
cage.</p>
<p>As they all went outside, they saw the crewmen
unloading the cargo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the colony over there,&rdquo; Mr. Shannon
said, pointing to a high framework that
looked something like an oil derrick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They mine here for a mineral called
magna. It&rsquo;s very valuable, because without it
we couldn&rsquo;t have atomic engines. Magna is
what keeps our rocket tubes from melting under
the terrific heat that goes through them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we go down into the mines, Dad?&rdquo;
Steve asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see if we can,&rdquo; said his father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>As they walked toward the mining place,
Mr. Shannon said, &ldquo;Underneath us are pockets
of poisonous gas like that found in Jupiter&rsquo;s
atmosphere. Sometimes it leaks into the mining
tunnels causing danger from suffocation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure hope the gas stays where it belongs
while we&rsquo;re down there!&rdquo; Steve said and swallowed
the lump of fear in his throat.</p>
<p>They turned their attention to Jupiter. It
looked even more like a beach ball now with
its stripes of beautiful colors. Mr. Shannon
said the bands were floating ice bergs of the
poisonous gases he was talking about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No ship can land on Jupiter,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Its
gravity would crush a spaceman flat. Gravity
pull is much stronger on the larger planets,
you know. Jupiter&rsquo;s atmosphere is many thousands
of miles deep. Raging storms are going
on beneath it all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ooo!&rdquo; Sue gasped. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re close
enough to it then!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Other wonders of the sky were the round
beacons of Jupiter&rsquo;s other moons, three of
which were about the same size as Callisto.
They hung like bright searchlights in the
starry heavens.</p>
<p>The men at the mining place greeted the
Shannons warmly. They had not seen anyone
from Earth for so long that they had grown
very lonely.</p>
<p>The chief mining engineer said he would
be glad to take the visitors on an underground
tour. His name was Dr. Harding. He was
plump and short and wore black-rimmed
glasses inside his space helmet.</p>
<p>He led them into an elevator and it sank
into the darkness. Steve remembered about
the poisonous gases that crept about underground
and it made him shiver to think about
it.</p>
<p>Dr. Harding watched Bud hopping around
uncomfortably inside his small space cage.
&ldquo;Do you remember, Mr. Shannon,&rdquo; he asked
over his suit radio, &ldquo;when they used to use
canary birds in mines to warn about leaking
gas? The birds would notice it first and give
the miners time to get out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read about that, Dr. Harding,&rdquo; said
Mr. Shannon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we have automatic warning machines
in the tunnels to do that,&rdquo; the chief engineer
told Sue and Steve.</p>
<p>Deeper and deeper below the soil of Callisto
the elevator sank. At last the cage reached the
bottom, and the riders found themselves in
a large cavern. There were machines and men
all about, working busily. Tracks led off into
tunnels and ore cars were running on them.
Some were going empty into the tunnels while
others were coming out full of rock and gravel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The magna is separated from the rock in
that big machine over there,&rdquo; Dr. Harding explained.
&ldquo;Want to ride an ore car into one of
the tunnels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; Steve spoke up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mine is air-conditioned,&rdquo; the chief
engineer said, &ldquo;so we can take off our helmets.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>This done, Steve let Bud out of his cage.
The little bird hopped up on his gloved finger,
saying, &ldquo;Rocket away!&rdquo; several times. His
two-word language seemed to do for everything.</p>
<p>One worker controlled all the cars at a main
switch in the middle of the cavern. The Shannons
and their guide climbed into an empty
ore car and it rolled into a tunnel.</p>
<p>Glistening dark rock crowded in on Sue and
Steve from all sides. Steve hoped the walls
were strong enough so they would not come
crashing down on their heads! There were
lights along the way to help brighten the
gloom.</p>
<p>After clicking along like a trolley for awhile,
the car came to the end of the line. It was a
large room with more machines and workmen.
The men were digging magna ore out of the
wall with drills.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>As Dr. Harding explained about the work,
Bud began flitting about as though sight-seeing
on his own. He was shy of the workers at
first, but then made friends with them. He
spoke to them with his favorite two words and
the men laughed in great fun to hear him.</p>
<p>Then a few minutes later, Bud began acting
queerly. He flew back to Steve&rsquo;s finger and
started wobbling as though dizzy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with him?&rdquo; Steve asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sick or something!&rdquo; Sue cried out.
She took the budgy from Steve and cuddled
him in her own gloves. But the little blue bird
seemed to be no better.</p>
<p>Dr. Harding walked over to look at the bird.
Then he ordered, &ldquo;Everybody into the ore
car! We have to get out of here fast! Sue, hold
the bird up close to your suit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The workers dropped their tools as if they
were red hot and climbed into the car. Mr.
Shannon helped Sue and Steve on, then
jumped on himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Dr. Harding pressed the electric button that
was the signal to the operator in the main cavern
to move the car. The car began to roll
down the track. It picked up speed as Dr.
Harding kept pressing the button.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leaking gas, Dr. Harding?&rdquo; Mr. Shannon
asked worriedly.</p>
<p>The chief engineer nodded. He sniffed the
air like a hunting dog after a scent. &ldquo;Take a
deep breath, everyone, then hold it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve thought his lungs would burst, but
finally Dr. Harding let them take another deep
breath. By the time they had taken one more,
the car had reached the main cavern. As it
rolled to a stop, Dr. Harding jumped down
and ran over to the car operator.</p>
<p>Steve saw a door slide down and close off the
tunnel where they had come out. Then the
little man gave a deep sigh and took off his
black-rimmed glasses to wipe them.</p>
<p>Sue and Steve watched Bud hopefully. He
was standing more steadily on Sue&rsquo;s finger
now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; the chief engineer
said. &ldquo;We sure owe Bud a lot for warning
us the way he did. Something must have
happened to the warning machine. It was
supposed to set off a siren.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it weren&rsquo;t for Bud we might have been
overcome before we could have gotten out of
there!&rdquo; Mr. Shannon added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so right!&rdquo; Dr. Harding said. &ldquo;The
men will go back in there in gas masks to find
the leak and see what&rsquo;s wrong with the warning
machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re plenty lucky!&rdquo; Steve sighed, his
spine still prickly from their narrow escape.</p>
<p>Sue kissed the budgy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a hero, Bud,&rdquo;
she told him, &ldquo;and we love you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud blinked lazily. Then as if to show that
he was all right again, he squawked, &ldquo;Rocket
away!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="27" /></div><h2 id="c8"><br /><i>THE BIG SHOW ON TITAN</i></h2>
<p>The space freighter had landed
on Titan, the largest moon in all the Solar System.
The Shannon twins had been anxious to
reach this moon of Saturn because their father
had told them that something very exciting
might happen here before they left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>There was still another reason why the children
had looked forward to the landing. They
would meet a boy of their own age who was
the son of a worker. He had been living on
Titan for the past two years and would be able
to show them around.</p>
<p>Steve and Sue came down the outside &ldquo;gangway&rdquo;
of the cargo ship and stepped onto the
frozen ground of the distant world. The twins
wore space suits, of course, for the air outside
was extremely cold and it was poisonous as
well with raw methane and ammonia.</p>
<p>Steve saw beautiful Saturn, with its colored
rings, filling much of the blue sky. Titan was
a world of close mountains, worn smooth by
lots of windy weather. A film of glistening ice
covered the peaks like caps of glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look up there, Sue!&rdquo; Steve said. &ldquo;Over
our heads! That&rsquo;s the famous skyport of Titan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could go up there!&rdquo; Sue said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll get the chance,&rdquo; answered
Steve.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Ahead of them stood a rounded plastic
dome. Men were carrying into it cartons of
supplies which the space freighter had
brought. The twins&rsquo; father, who was an official
of the American Space Supply Company, was
still aboard to take care of the unloading.</p>
<p>A boy came out of the domed building.
&ldquo;Are you the Shannons?&rdquo; he asked over his
space radio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we are,&rdquo; Steve replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Bobby King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sue and Steve said they were glad to meet
him. He asked if they would like to go up and
see the skyport.</p>
<p>Both the young Shannons answered a quick,
&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; together.</p>
<p>They followed their new friend into the
plastic dome. Bobby King pointed to an overhead
cable. Hanging from the heavy cord was
a cable car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; Bobby called, like a train
conductor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Sue and Steve giggled with pleasure as they
entered the car, followed by Bobby. Bobby
pushed a switch and the cable car began to
move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going up like a corkscrew,&rdquo; Bobby
said.</p>
<p>Round and round, right out of the top of
the building, moved the cable car. Up and up
it went. It took about ten minutes to reach the
top. As soon as they got out, two men passed
them who were talking about a storm that was
on the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, if there&rsquo;s a storm coming, you two are
sure in luck!&rdquo; Bobby told Sue and Steve.</p>
<p>Steve and Sue looked at one another, puzzled.
Why should their young friend be pleased
over a coming storm?</p>
<p>They saw before them a space that looked
as flat as a highway and larger than a football
field. There was a row of hangars along the far
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow, we sure must be high!&rdquo; Steve burst
out. They seemed to be almost on a level with
the mountains.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a whole mile off the ground,&rdquo;
Bobby told him. &ldquo;The skyport rests on the
corners of two mountain ridges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went over to one of the clear plastic
walls that edged the skyport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, the freighter sure is little down
there!&rdquo; Sue said.</p>
<p>It almost took Steve&rsquo;s breath away. The big
space ship indeed looked no larger than a toy
down below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did they go to such trouble to build
this?&rdquo; Steve asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because there wasn&rsquo;t any place flat enough
on the ground,&rdquo; Bobby answered. &ldquo;My father
says they need a main skyport on Titan because
there are so many companies here digging
for uranium. The colonists fly here to get
their supplies and mail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see some dark clouds over the mountains,&rdquo;
Sue said. &ldquo;Does that mean a storm is
coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobby&rsquo;s helmet nodded. &ldquo;It sure does! You
two are the luckiest ones! You got here right
at the start of the storm season.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Steve and Sue were still puzzled as to why
Bobby wanted it to storm.</p>
<p>Bobby showed his guests a faint star burning
through the blue atmosphere. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
Earth,&rdquo; he told them, &ldquo;750 million miles
away. My father thinks we can go back for a
visit in a few weeks. I&rsquo;ll be glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you live here, Bobby?&rdquo; Sue
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father and I stay in an apartment a
little way from here,&rdquo; Bobby answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about school?&rdquo; Steve wanted to know.
&ldquo;Do they have one on Titan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobby shook his head. &ldquo;My father teaches
me. He&rsquo;s out with some prospectors today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobby showed them Titan&rsquo;s other nine
sister moons, which looked like glowing fireballs.
Steve saw that most of the daylight came
from Saturn because the sun was so far away.
It wasn&rsquo;t nearly as bright here as it was on
Earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could run over to Saturn for a
visit,&rdquo; Sue said, jokingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really, Sue,&rdquo; Bobby told her.
&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t stand up in its heavy gravity.
Saturn&rsquo;s almost as big as Jupiter, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are Saturn&rsquo;s rings made of?&rdquo; Steve
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oodles and oodles of rocks,&rdquo; Bobby replied.
&ldquo;They are traveling so fast that they
make the rings look like one solid piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wind was beginning to howl around them
and this seemed to make Bobby very excited.</p>
<p>The coming storm must be something special,
Steve thought. His curiosity had been
aroused strongly.</p>
<p>The clouds gathered darker and more
thickly behind the mountains. The wind was
driving harder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better go inside?&rdquo; Sue asked,
worriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks, no!&rdquo; Bobby said. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be any
fun unless we&rsquo;re right out in it! There won&rsquo;t
be any rain. It&rsquo;s too cold on Titan for rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly the three heard a loud siren wail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;That means a jet plane is coming in,&rdquo;
Bobby said. &ldquo;All planes have to land when
word of a storm gets around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plane&rsquo;s wheels touched down and the
ship rolled along until a hook on it caught a
line that stretched across the runway. The line
brought the plane to a sharp halt.</p>
<p>The jet&rsquo;s wings were folded down and the
ship was pushed off to a hangar. Two more
ships landed afterward. Then a blinding flash
lighted up the sky. It made Steve and Sue
blink and jump in fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Bobby exclaimed. &ldquo;The storm has
begun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other men had come out to see what was
going to happen and they lined up along the
edges of the skyport with the children.</p>
<p>Bobby pointed to a sparkling balloon of
light that burst into a blossom of sparks over
the mountains. A moment later a red dagger
flash skipped across the peaks. During all this
there were loud crashes and rumblings. Steve
was scared and thrilled at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like fireworks!&rdquo; Sue called out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Now Steve could understand why Bobby
had looked forward to the storm. He guessed,
too, that this was the exciting surprise their
father had said might happen while they were
here.</p>
<p>An orange pinwheel, like a Fourth of July
sparkler, rose from a mountain top and looped
upward. It grew bigger and bigger and fainter
and fainter at the same time. It was really a
beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What causes the fireworks?&rdquo; Steve asked
above the noise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partly strong wind,&rdquo; Bobby said loudly,
&ldquo;and partly Titan&rsquo;s gases exploding against the
mountain tops!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They watched spellbound for fifteen minutes,
then a half hour. The Shannons were
sure they had never seen anything quite so
breathtaking as this.</p>
<p>At one time a row of peaks seemed to glow
with a sheet of red flame. The flame danced
and flickered like a forest fire for a long time
before it faded out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>The children had been enjoying themselves
so thoroughly that they knew nothing of the
peril that was heading their way.</p>
<p>The first warning came when one of the
skyport men standing nearby shouted over
his space suit radio. Steve whirled in alarm.
His heart seemed to stop beating completely
for a terrible moment.</p>
<p>A tardy plane had come in for a landing on
the sky platform. But the howling wind had
kept everyone from hearing the warning siren.</p>
<p>Because of the fierce blowing, the plane had
not hooked firmly to the braking line. It
scooted off to the side and was heading for the
very spot where Bobby, Steve and Sue stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bobby!&rdquo; Steve cried. &ldquo;Get out of the way!&rdquo;
As Bobby ducked for safety, Steve also moved
quickly. Sue screamed as Bobby grabbed her
hastily by her space glove. He had to jerk her
sharply in order to get her out of the path of
the runaway plane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>The plane crashed into the plastic wall of
the skyport, tearing out a section of wall as
though it were thin cardboard. The ship was
left dangling on the very edge as if ready to
fall a mile to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor pilot!&rdquo; Sue cried. &ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t
look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the skyport men had come running
quickly over and together they pulled the jet
plane back to safety. They helped the scared
pilot out. He walked shakily off into one of
the hangars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! That was close!&rdquo; Steve breathed.
&ldquo;For him and us, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heart is still thumping like a drum!&rdquo;
Bobby said.</p>
<p>As for Sue, she was too upset to say anything
at all.</p>
<p>They turned to look at the fireworks to take
their minds off the accident. The wonderful
ending of the show almost made them forget
it completely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>They saw a dazzling white light burst like
an empty volcano. The banner of fire rose as
high into the sky as huge Saturn. Then it
spilled over like a great fountain. It changed
into purple, then blue, green and red.</p>
<p>Before dying out, it gave the big planet a
lovely ruddy glow, showing up its rings like a
gleaming necklace of rubies. That was the end
of Nature&rsquo;s grand performance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow, wasn&rsquo;t that terrific?&rdquo; Steve asked.
&ldquo;A show like that in a grandstand on Earth
would cost you three-and-a-half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe four!&rdquo; Sue chimed in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t see this show anywhere on Earth,
Steve,&rdquo; Bobby said. &ldquo;Titan is the only place.
And the good thing about it is that it&rsquo;s all for
free!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="27" /></div><h2 id="c9"><br /><i>ADVENTURE ON THE SUN&rsquo;S DOORSTEP</i></h2>
<p>Sue and Steve Shannon watched
the magic world of stardust through a port of
the rocket freighter. The ship was moving under
power of its atomic engines, headed toward
the sun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>They had one more cargo stop to make before
returning to their beloved soil on the
Earth.</p>
<p>The twins heard the clack of magnetic
soles behind them. Without such shoes holding
them to the floor, space travelers would
float about helplessly like wingless birds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, kids,&rdquo; greeted their father. &ldquo;Growing
tired of the view?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I am, Dad,&rdquo; Steve admitted. His
blue eyes were tired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far away is Apollo&rsquo;s Chariot now?&rdquo;
Sue asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Shannon grinned. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the umpteenth
time you two have asked that. But I
suppose I&rsquo;m as restless as you are to get back
to Mom in Arkansas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing this made Steve suddenly homesick.
There was really no place like home, just
like the poet had said. Steve knew Sue felt the
same way. He had seen a wistful look in her
hazel eyes every time they had talked of Little
Rock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>The seemingly endless days finally did end.
The three Shannons went up into the lookout
dome with the crewmen. The dome was covered
by a darkened plastic screen to cut down
the blinding glare of the sun, which was very
close.</p>
<p>It was a heart-stopping sight for Sue and
Steve. The planet Mercury covered the face of
the sun like a black plate. Streaming out from
the edges were mountainous tongues of living
fire. Mr. Shannon called this flaming halo the
sun&rsquo;s <i>chromosphere</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, what a thing to see!&rdquo; Steve gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s unbelievable!&rdquo; Sue added, breathless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, it is,&rdquo; Mr. Shannon agreed. &ldquo;See
that thing like a lighted wheel just ahead of
us? That&rsquo;s Apollo&rsquo;s Chariot. It was named after
the famous Greek sun god, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Sue and Steve knew that Apollo&rsquo;s Chariot
was really a space laboratory that was a home
for scientists who were studying the sun. They
had been the ones who had given their tiny
world its colorful nickname. It was protected
with asbestos and other special material to
shield it from the heat as it circled the great
star, month after month, year after year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had to contact Apollo&rsquo;s Chariot while
Mercury was shading our ship from the sun&rsquo;s
rays,&rdquo; Mr. Shannon said. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t protected
like Apollo&rsquo;s Chariot is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercury seems as big as the sun, the way
it covers it completely,&rdquo; Steve remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re so close to Mercury,&rdquo;
his father explained. &ldquo;Actually, the sun is so
much bigger it&rsquo;s like comparing a pinpoint to
a grapefruit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the midnight darkness between the ships,
giant searchlights had to be turned on. Then
the scientists on the other ship came out onto
their loading platform to receive their cargo.
Conversation was carried on by means of space
suit radios with those aboard the freighter,
who stood on their own outside platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we get closer to Apollo&rsquo;s Chariot?&rdquo;
Steve asked Biff Warren, who was the
twins&rsquo; favorite among the crewmen. Biff was
piling boxes and crates at the edge of the platform.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;Space regulations,&rdquo; answered Biff. &ldquo;If a
meteor should hit one of us, the other ship
would explode too if we were close. Also,
rocket tubes are so tricky that you never know
when one is going to misfire and send your
ship scooting off suddenly in the wrong direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One end of a double cable was fastened to
rings on the freighter&rsquo;s platform. Then the
other end was tossed across the space between
the two ships and attached by the scientists
to their own side.</p>
<p>Steve saw the crewmen around him pick up
cords from out of the cable equipment box.
They fastened one end to buckles on their
suits and the other to the cable. Steve guessed
that the lines were a safety measure to keep
the men from drifting off into space as they
carried the cargo across.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>The first crewman picked up a crate as
lightly as if it were a pile of feathers. Then
with his foot he shoved off from the platform.</p>
<p>He guided the crate through the emptiness
with his gloved hands and the men on the opposite
platform helped him aboard. Another
crewman stepped off the freighter with another
crate. Then another crewman with another
piece of cargo. The carriers returned by
the other cable line.</p>
<p>Steve went over to his dad who, as an official
of the American Space Supply Company, was
supervising the work as always. &ldquo;Dad, may
Sue and I carry a box across? We&rsquo;ll be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Shannon thought a moment. &ldquo;I suppose
it will be all right. There&rsquo;s no way you can
go adrift if you fasten on to the cable. But you
have to be careful you&rsquo;re snapped on securely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Shannon made a place for them in line.
Sue in front. There was a wait before Sue&rsquo;s
turn so that more crates could be placed on
the platform&rsquo;s edge. The children looked beyond
Apollo&rsquo;s Chariot at the huge black circle
of Mercury as it masked the mighty sun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;Biff,&rdquo; Steve asked his friend as he was
stacking the crates, &ldquo;why couldn&rsquo;t the Apollo
scientists study the sun from Mercury?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff chuckled and it made a funny crackling
sound over the young Shannons&rsquo; radios. &ldquo;Men
will land on Mercury when they grow hides
of asbestos, Steve. It&rsquo;s so hot on the sunward
side that there are supposed to be lakes and
pools of lead there! The other side never sees
the sun, so you can imagine how cold it is!
Think you two would like to go there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; Sue answered for both
of them.</p>
<p>When the next piece of cargo was ready to
go over, Biff checked the children&rsquo;s safety
cords. Then he let Sue push off from the platform
with a box in front of her. A few moments
later, Steve followed. The boy heard
his sister giggle excitedly as they floated across.
Searchlight beams were in their eyes but they
didn&rsquo;t mind. Steve, too, thought this great fun
after being cramped for so long on the
freighter. He looked down at the empty space
below, but he knew he could not fall and so
was not afraid. Reaching the other platform,
he and his sister were helped aboard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;They sure are using young crewmen these
days!&rdquo; joked one of the scientists, a tall man
who seemed to be working harder than the
others. &ldquo;Nice work, young folks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scientist was in the act of changing the
children&rsquo;s cords over to the returning cable
when a slight mishap occurred. One of the
crates coming over bumped into him. He
laughed as he again got to his feet but his
laughter quickly changed to alarm when Sue
suddenly pushed off from the platform. She
had thought her cable line was secure and that
she was ready to make the exciting trip back
across the gulf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, miss!&rdquo; the scientist called. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
finish fastening your cable cord!&rdquo; He reached
for Sue but her suit slipped out of the fingers
of his bulky space gloves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Steve froze for an instant in terror at what
he had seen. Then without thought of anything
else except his sister&rsquo;s danger, he dove
right off the platform after Sue, not realizing
or caring that his own cable cord was not
fastened.</p>
<p>If the scientist had not grabbed for Sue
she might have floated safely across to the
freighter. But by touching her he had sent
her off in a direction beneath it.</p>
<p>Over his radio, Steve heard her screaming
for help and saw her flinging her arms and
legs about like a drowning swimmer. Steve
was moving faster than she and presently
caught up with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do, Steve?&rdquo; she cried,
holding tightly to him. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stop! And
it&rsquo;s so dark out here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve knew that unless someone came to
their aid they would drift on and on since
there was no air to slow them down. But he
didn&rsquo;t tell Sue this.</p>
<p>He remembered, as he had at times before,
that a spaceman must keep his head in an
emergency. He spoke comforting words to Sue,
telling her to try to be calm, that help would
be coming.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<div class="img" id="pic4">

<p class="caption"><i>He saw her flinging her arms and legs about like a drowning swimmer</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Even as he told her this a spear of light hit
them and a voice broke in on their radio:
&ldquo;Steve! Sue! Stop struggling! I&rsquo;m on my way
to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biff!&rdquo; Steve exclaimed, and the dread in
his heart suddenly lifted. He looked over his
shoulder and saw their big friend approaching,
guided by the light that had been flashed
on them from the freighter.</p>
<p>There was a little plume of flame trailing
behind him. In a few minutes he had caught
up with them. Sue was so glad to see him she
grabbed the big spaceman and her helmet
bumped against his in an attempted kiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad to see you, Biff!&rdquo; she
sobbed. &ldquo;I was so <i>awfully</i> scared!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right now,&rdquo; Biff said gently.
&ldquo;Both of you hold on to me and we&rsquo;ll go back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Steve took Biff&rsquo;s left arm and Sue firmly
grasped one of Steve&rsquo;s. Biff carried a type of
hand rocket, called a &ldquo;pusher,&rdquo; that he had
used to shoot himself along toward them. By
pointing the rocket in the opposite direction
from which he wanted to go, the &ldquo;pusher&rdquo;
pushed him in the manner of the rocket tubes
on the freighter.</p>
<p>Biff pointed the pusher away from the
freighter. Steve saw a burst of fire beside them
and the three of them sped off toward the big
ship. As Sue reached the platform, her father
was there to help her aboard. She could see
in his eyes the fear he had felt for them.</p>
<p>Steve was surprised to have the crew greet
him warmly with pats on the back. The boy
turned to his father. &ldquo;Why are they calling me
a hero?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;It was Biff who saved us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not taking credit away from Biff, any good
spaceman would have done what he did,&rdquo; said
Mr. Shannon. &ldquo;But few would have attempted
your trick of jumping into space after your
sister with no way of getting back. Right,
Biff?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>Biff nodded his plastic helmet. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t
the smartest thing you could have done, Steve,
but it showed your bravery. Courage counts
just as much as ability in a spaceman. Don&rsquo;t
ever forget that, son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve, who wanted to be a spaceman some
day, would not forget it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="27" /></div><h2 id="c10"><br /><i>THE FLYING MOUNTAIN</i></h2>
<p>Steve and Sue were playing a
game as the freighter headed through space
toward Earth. It was fun trying to see who
could build the higher tower of sticks. The
young Shannons were in extra good spirits.
Before long they would be seeing Mom and
their home in Arkansas, after being in space
for so many months.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Steve carefully placed the last stick on his
tower which was almost as high as he could
reach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> won, Sis!&rdquo; he exclaimed. But as he drew
his hand away, it brushed against the tower,
causing the sticks to drift off in all directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> won!&rdquo; Sue cried gleefully, &ldquo;Yours broke
up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve made a face and began picking the
sticks out of the air before they floated too
far. It was lack of weight in space that made it
possible to play such a game. The twins
would have hung in the air like the sticks if
their shoe soles were not held to the floor by
magnetism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll beat you next time,&rdquo; Steve boasted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Before they could start again, their father
came into the room. &ldquo;It looks as though we
may not be getting home as quickly as we had
expected, kids. Captain Furman has received
an S. O. S. from a passenger rocket that&rsquo;s
down on the asteroid, Sierra.&rdquo; The twins
knew an asteroid to be one of the thousands
of tiny planets in the Solar System.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we going to her aid?&rdquo; Steve asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It depends on whether we have enough
fuel or not,&rdquo; his father replied. &ldquo;Even atomic
fuel runs out sometime, you know. Captain
Furman is talking with his officers now. It&rsquo;ll
be a shame if we can&rsquo;t help the <i>Pole Star</i>&mdash;as
much as I want to see Mom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was just like his unselfish dad to say that,
Steve thought. He felt the same way about it.
And he didn&rsquo;t doubt that tender-hearted Sue
was of the same mind.</p>
<p>Mr. Shannon started out of the room again.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see what they are going to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve and Sue went back to their game. But
somehow it wasn&rsquo;t as much fun now. People
were in trouble and trouble in space was
often a frightening thing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>It seemed like a long time before their
father came back. He walked in so fast that
his magnetic shoes sounded like tiny hammers.
&ldquo;Kids,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the captain wants to
see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Us?</i>&rdquo; Steve asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Come quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went out, leaving some sticks in mid-air
and others drifting off. The young Shannons
walked shyly into the captain&rsquo;s room
where all the officers stood. Steve felt out of
place among the neatly uniformed spacemen.</p>
<p>Mr. Shannon was in charge of cargo which
the freighter dropped off at different ports in
space, for he was an official of the American
Space Supply Company. But he had nothing
to do with the running of the ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young folks,&rdquo; said the tall captain, who
had a blond mustache, &ldquo;we want you to help
us solve a problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; Steve asked, puzzled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; went on the chief, in his
booming voice. &ldquo;If we go on past Earth to
Sierra to help the <i>Pole Star</i>, it&rsquo;ll leave us with
only a fifty-fifty chance of having enough fuel
to reach Earth. But the <i>Pole Star</i> is running
short of supplies and their radio just went
dead a while ago. It&rsquo;s too late to get help from
Earth. The crew is divided on what we
should do, so I decided to call you two in to
see what you think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A husky crewman spoke out boldly, &ldquo;What
do these kids know about space, Captain?
They&rsquo;re not even old enough to be out here!
I say stick to our course and get this crew and
ship back safely to Earth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remark angered Steve, but the spaceman
looked too big to talk back to. Sue wasn&rsquo;t
so timid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourself!&rdquo;
she exclaimed. &ldquo;Thinking of yourself when
other people are in trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve and his father were surprised at Sue&rsquo;s
outburst. Captain Furman and the other
crewmen smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think that solves our problem,&rdquo; the captain
spoke firmly. &ldquo;If the young lady has
courage enough to overlook the risk, the rest
of us should have it, too. Thank you, Sue.
We move at full rocket thrust to aid the <i>Pole
Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Shannons went out into the corridor,
Steve asked his sister, &ldquo;Wow, Sue, what
made you talk back to that big fellow like
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was so selfish!&rdquo; Sue answered. &ldquo;Besides,
it made me mad to hear him say we
didn&rsquo;t know anything about space! Why,
we&rsquo;ve been over almost all of the Solar System,
haven&rsquo;t we, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father pressed her shoulder. &ldquo;Of
course, honey. I&rsquo;m proud of you, because I
felt the same way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took a few days for the freighter to reach
the asteroid. The space ship, in going past
the Earth, had come close enough for the
Earth to be seen as a misty, green light. It
made the twins long for home as they saw it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sierra is like a big meteor, isn&rsquo;t it, Dad?&rdquo;
Steve asked, as the three of them looked
downward on the flat, egg-shaped rock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>His father nodded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s often called, &lsquo;The
Flying Mountain,&rsquo; because of the low peaks
on it. Sierra is only a mile long and less than
that wide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember from school that it wasn&rsquo;t discovered
until 1965,&rdquo; Sue said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s so small and isn&rsquo;t very
bright in the sky,&rdquo; her father spoke. &ldquo;Most
of the asteroids are much farther out, between
Mars and Jupiter, but a few come in
close to Earth like Sierra, Hermes, Eros and
some others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The freighter landed safely in a flat area
about two hundred feet from the <i>Pole Star</i>.
The Shannons could see the damaged space
ship jammed against a cliff. Brilliant sunshine
reflected upward from bare dark rock,
dazzling their eyes. It was over a hundred
degrees on Sierra, for there was no atmosphere
to check the sun&rsquo;s heat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, what a place for a sunburn!&rdquo; Steve
said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly summertime on Sierra!&rdquo; Sue
added.</p>
<p>They watched crewmen in space suits come
out of the freighter and begin uncoiling a
spool of rope that would stretch between the
two ships. Safety lines led from all the men
back to the cargo ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s almost no gravity at all here,&rdquo;
Mr. Shannon told his son and daughter, &ldquo;because
the asteroid is so small. If the people
from the <i>Pole Star</i>&mdash;providing there are any
alive&mdash;didn&rsquo;t have the rope to hang on to, they
might float right off Sierra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children asked to go outside. The
three suited up and went out, using safety
lines, just in case.</p>
<p>The glare was so strong that they had to
lower their darkening glasses over the face
part of their helmets. The heat was such that
they had to switch on the cooling outfits in
their suits. It was strange to see the edge of
the asteroid so close, just beyond a fringe of
dagger-like peaks. It was like being on a big
space raft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>The twins tried walking. They were less
than feather-light and it was quite a job for
them even to keep upright. Sue decided this
wouldn&rsquo;t be a very good place to spend a summer
vacation.</p>
<p>Sue&rsquo;s cooling outfit made her sneeze. She
was lifted right off the ground and her father
had to pull her down quickly. She and Steve
laughed but they had been scared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, it doesn&rsquo;t take much to send you sky
high!&rdquo; Mr. Shannon joked, speaking over the
radio set which all three of them carried in
their space suits.</p>
<p>At last the crewmen, who had been moving
so carefully over the ground toward the
<i>Pole Star</i>, reached the ship and fastened the
rope to it. The outer door of the <i>Pole Star</i>
was then opened by someone inside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness somebody&rsquo;s alive in
there!&rdquo; Mr. Shannon said thankfully. &ldquo;I guess
the ship just coasted into the rock wall without
too much force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The freighter crew began helping people
out of the passenger rocket. If things weren&rsquo;t
so serious, it would have been funny for Sue
and Steve to see them in their balloon-like
space suits, bouncing one careful step at a
time and holding on for dear life to the rope.</p>
<p>As the party neared the freighter, the twins
suddenly saw their father dash toward the
ship. In his haste, Mr. Shannon seemed to
have forgotten where he was and went scooting
upward like a high-jumper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; Sue and Steve cried out together.</p>
<p>Mr. Shannon had to put out his hands and
feet at the last minute to keep from crashing
into the wall of the freighter. Then he pulled
himself down to the ground with his safety
line. When they saw that their father was unhurt,
Sue and Steve began walking toward the
ship with careful steps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>They heard their dad exclaim, &ldquo;Mr. Ballinger!&rdquo;
as he walked over to one of the men
from the <i>Pole Star</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Shannon!&rdquo; the man said.</p>
<p>It turned out that Mr. Ballinger was the
president of the American Space Supply
Company and was Mr. Shannon&rsquo;s boss. Mr.
Ballinger explained that the <i>Pole Star</i> was
heading for Mars when there was an explosion
in the rocket tubes. By landing on Sierra
the captain thought there was a better chance
of their being found than if they had just
kept drifting in space, because all ships knew
the path of &ldquo;The Flying Mountain.&rdquo; No one
had been hurt in the landing and the <i>Pole
Star</i> had enough fuel to get the freighter back
to Earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I should fire you
people or not for risking my good freighter
just to save an old codger like me!&rdquo; the
friendly Mr. Ballinger joked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We almost didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s dad reminded
him and explained how Sue&rsquo;s outburst had
decided the problem.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve certainly got some smart ones
there, John,&rdquo; Mr. Ballinger said, smiling at
Sue and Steve. &ldquo;Your son has already proved
himself a hero before and now it&rsquo;s Sue. Yes,
sir, I sure wish I had a pair like them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the twins scarcely heard him. They
were thinking that, in spite of the great fun
they had had on all their space adventures,
how wonderful it was going to be to see Mom
again and set foot on the grandest planet in
all the Solar System&mdash;Earth!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="27" /></div><h2 id="c11"><br /><i>CASTAWAYS IN SPACE</i></h2>
<p>The two of them had just
shoved the supply case against the chute door
when the space ship gave an unexpected burst
of rocket power, knocking Skip Miller against
the release lever. The escape door shot up and
a big square of black space opened before the
boys&rsquo; eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>Glen Hartzell was stunned to see his friend
go spinning down the incline and follow the
supply case toward the open door. Automatically,
Glen stretched his lean body full length
trying to grasp Skip&rsquo;s space suit before he escaped.
But his momentum sent him skidding
down the slope and the next thing he knew
he was out in space, too.</p>
<p>A week ago Glen wouldn&rsquo;t have cared
whether he faced death or not. He and Skip
had just made the scorned fraternity of
&ldquo;Wockies,&rdquo; washed-out cadets. His failure had
cut like a knife. He had wanted to pilot ships
through the depths of space more than anything
else in the world. Instead, he and Skip
had been assigned to ground crews on Mars.
That, at least, had been their destination until
Skip&rsquo;s elbow unexpectedly made them castaways
in space.</p>
<p>Glen&rsquo;s first thought was directed to Skip,
who looked like a toy balloon as he drifted
through the vacuum. &ldquo;Skip!&rdquo; he called over
his space suit radio. &ldquo;Do you hear me, Skip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, Glen,&rdquo; Skip&rsquo;s reply was scarcely
more than a squeak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>Glen looked down and ahead where a massive
rock some ten miles in diameter hung
in the starry emptiness. &ldquo;If we can make
Phobos, we may be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re done for,&rdquo; Skip groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not!&rdquo; Glen&rsquo;s wits were sharpened
by the danger. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re lined up pretty well
with Phobos. She doesn&rsquo;t have any gravity to
speak of and we may be able to land on her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t make Phobos,&rdquo; Skip argued.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll either run into Mars&rsquo; gravity field and
crash on its surface or float through space until
our air runs out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Skip!&rdquo; Glen&rsquo;s tone was sharp.
&ldquo;Listen to me. See if you can pick up a little
speed by kicking out behind with your feet
and hands. If you can catch up with the supply
case, hang on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>Skip didn&rsquo;t reply but Glen saw his arms and
legs begin to move. Glen worked his own. It
was a grueling effort, but Glen found that he
was able to increase his speed much in the
manner of a space ship&rsquo;s thrust. By the time
Glen touched Skip&rsquo;s suit, both of them were
sucking freely of their precious oxygen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea?&rdquo; Skip asked as his gloved
hand clutched the strap of the supply case and
Glen held onto him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll use the case as a buffer to break our
fall,&rdquo; Glen explained. &ldquo;Remember, it&rsquo;s covered
with foam rubber so that it won&rsquo;t shatter
when it hits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two had been preparing to drop the
emergency supply case on Mars at the time of
the accident. Glen was glad now that they&rsquo;d
donned space suits.</p>
<p>Glen saw that the space ship was now only
a tiny needle against the red disk of Mars. He
and Skip had probably not even been missed
by the crew. When they did find out, they
wouldn&rsquo;t know where to look for the boys.</p>
<p>Phobos was a jagged, frightening giant below,
but Glen held nothing but love for it.
Their speed had increased slightly, but it did
not look as if they would hit the ground dangerously
fast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Glen felt Skip&rsquo;s muscles tense for the landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, fellow!&rdquo; Glen breathed.</p>
<p>He felt a rough jar in the pit of his stomach.
Glen bounced off Skip&rsquo;s back as though he
were rubber. He spread out his arms to ease
his fall, then was surprised to find his body
settling down to rest as lightly as a leaf.</p>
<p>Glen felt a prickly chill in his cheeks.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got practically no weight at all!&rdquo; he
breathed. Skip had almost drifted off into
space again, but Glen grabbed his leg and
pulled him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a crazy world, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Skip searched
the rocky landscape that sloped down from
them on both sides. It was weird to be on a
globe so tiny you were conscious of its roundness.</p>
<p>Glenn nodded. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve <i>really</i> got to keep
both feet on the ground!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if they don&rsquo;t find us, Glen?&rdquo; Skip
asked. &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Skip,&rdquo; Glen sighed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
see what&rsquo;s in the supply case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glen was able to crawl better than he could
walk over to the supply case. Skip followed.
Glen pressed a button on the case and the top
sprang up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! There&rsquo;s not much that isn&rsquo;t included!&rdquo;
Skip said. &ldquo;Spare oxygen tanks, a
bubble tent outfit, food capsules, water maker,
first-aid, flares, books, electronic stove-heater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s put up the bubble tent,&rdquo; Glen said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll help save our heat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he had learned in cadet training, he removed
a cylinder from the outfit and pulled a
lever. It popped open and a plastic bubble began
growing out of it. The bubble, which was
slightly oblong and transparent, enlarged to
about seven feet, then detached itself from the
cartridge airtight. After it had hardened for
several minutes, Glen took an electric saw
from the kit and cut a small door in the side.
They made hinges from self-sealing plastic
strips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>They used the foam rubber from around
the case for flooring, then put the supplies inside
the bubble. They turned on the heater
and then turned off the heat units in their
suits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long do you figure our supplies can
last, Glen?&rdquo; Skip asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re supposed to last two people ten
days,&rdquo; Glen replied. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember
that question on our exam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t remind me!&rdquo; Skip said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired
of hearing about the cadet corps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Glen said bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could they flunk us on one question?&rdquo;
Skip asked. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; Glen answered, &ldquo;but
the fact remains that we&rsquo;ve got to take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skip chuckled grimly. &ldquo;You talk as if we
have a lifetime ahead of us. We don&rsquo;t know
whether we&rsquo;ve got <i>tomorrow</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;Which reminds me, we&rsquo;d better send off
some flares to let somebody know where we
are.&rdquo; Glen picked up some of the rocket flares
and &ldquo;drifted&rdquo; out of the bubble tent. He set
up a flare on its tripod legs, pointed it at Mars&rsquo;
ruddy face and pulled on the release catch.
But it wouldn&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s jammed!&rdquo; Glen tried another rocket
and got the same result. Then another, and another.
They were all useless, all the catches
warped, possibly from having been kept too
near a heat source in the ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are we going to signal Mars now?&rdquo;
Skip asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything we toss out will be drawn to the
planet by its gravitation,&rdquo; Glen was thinking
out loud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about throwing out some of the extra
supplies we have?&rdquo; Skip proposed. &ldquo;We can
attach a note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a million-to-one shot they&rsquo;d be found.
Don&rsquo;t you realize that only a fraction of Mars
has colonists? No, I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;d wait here
until doomsday if we had to count on that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what else is there to do?&rdquo; Skip&rsquo;s eyes
were round with dread.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>Glen fought down his own sudden despair.
&ldquo;It looks as though we&rsquo;ll have to get to Mars
on our own, Skip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re crazy! We&rsquo;d be smashed to
pieces!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the way I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo; A plan was
forming in Glen&rsquo;s mind, as he scrambled into
the bubble tent and came out with one of their
engineering books. Skip watched in amazement
as Glen began working math problems
in the dirt with a piece of stone.</p>
<p>After a while, Glen said, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;ll work,
Skip. Want to take a chance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know what it is first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can use the chute from the supply
case and attach it to the bubble,&rdquo; Glen explained.
&ldquo;Then we can ride in the bubble to
Mars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds fantastic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve figured it every way I know,&rdquo; Glen
said. &ldquo;At least, it&rsquo;s better than sitting here and
hoping we&rsquo;ll accidentally be found. Shall we
try it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>Skip shrugged. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s our only chance. But
I hope you&rsquo;ve figured all the angles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better get started right away,&rdquo; Glen
advised. &ldquo;We may need all our air tanks if we
have to do some walking when we land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They set to work fastening the lines of the
chute around and under the plastic bubble.
They used more of the plastic strips to secure
the lines tightly. The chute was still folded,
since the vacuum on Phobos had failed to trip
the automatic release. The boys decided to
carry only a minimum of supplies to make
their weight as light as possible. When they
were ready to go, they climbed into the bubble
and Glen shoved them off with one foot outside
the door. Then he closed the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will it take us to get there?&rdquo; Skip
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve figured on about a hundred hours,&rdquo;
Glen answered. &ldquo;That should put us close to
Mars City, figuring on Mars&rsquo; rotation. But if
it doesn&rsquo;t, we should be able to reach some research
settlement.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>They moved slowly at first. Glen hoped for
only enough speed to carry them into Mars&rsquo;
gravity pull. As they approached the red planet,
their speed would increase and that worried
Glen. If they whacked into Mars&rsquo; air blanket
too fast, the chute might be ripped from the
bubble.</p>
<p>To while away the many hours, the boys
dozed and took turns reading the one novel
they had brought along. Their legs soon became
cramped and sore, and they would have
given a good deal to have been able to stretch
or walk about.</p>
<p>On the third day, the boys could see the
canals criss-crossing in a tangled network on
the ruddy globe of Mars. On the fourth day,
just as Glen had figured, the glassite domes of
Mars City began to show through the violet
haze of atmosphere. Glen wondered how fast
they were going. There was no way to tell because
their insulation kept them from feeling
the rush of air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cross your fingers, Skip,&rdquo; Glen warned.
&ldquo;Our chute should open in the next few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seconds appeared to last hours as they
waited, and Glen suffered a torture of suspense.
What if the chute did not open? In that
case, they would end up in fragments on Mars&rsquo;
red earth. Or what if the force of the air should
jerk the chute off the bubble?</p>
<p>Even as Glen worried, he felt a sharp drag
and was tumbled over on Skip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! The chute&rsquo;s open!&rdquo; Skip pointed
overhead.</p>
<p>Some minutes later, the red ground rushed
up at them like an enfolding blanket. Their
final problem faced them now. If they landed
safely, they would have conquered space in a
way no spaceman had ever done before.</p>
<p>Glen&rsquo;s muscles drew tight and his heart
thumped rapidly as the last few hundred feet
melted away. He wanted to close his eyes during
these final seconds but he forced himself
to watch the rising ground so that he could
brace himself at the moment of contact. He
was glad they had the foam rubber cushion beneath
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>Glen counted off the last few feet. &ldquo;A hundred&mdash;fifty&mdash;twenty&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they struck, Glen was thrown against the
ceiling of the bubble. Plastic clattered against
plastic as the bubble rolled over on the ground
many times before stopping. Glen straightened
himself out. He was shaken up but he was unhurt.
He looked across at Skip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We made it,&rdquo; Glen said, but his voice
shook, as if he wasn&rsquo;t yet able to believe it. He
tore off the door seals, shoved out the door.
Then they got out and stretched their legs.
Looking at the domes of Mars City in the distance,
Glen asked, &ldquo;Ready to start walking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After being cooped up like a chicken, I&rsquo;m
willing to walk all over Mars. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; Skip&rsquo;s
natural good humor had returned.</p>
<p>Less than an hour later, an astonished captain
at the Mars City spaceport heard the boys&rsquo;
strange story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your courage and ingenuity have been incredible!&rdquo;
the captain said when they had
finished. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that you two are
Wockies. If you weren&rsquo;t flunked for reasons of
scholarship, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be reinstated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t flunked for that reason, sir,&rdquo;
Skip said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what reason then?&rdquo; the captain asked.</p>
<p>Glen smiled wryly as he replied, &ldquo;We were
flunked, sir, because we failed the test to determine
whether we could bear up in an emergency
or not!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="27" /></div><h2 id="c12"><br /><i>THE BIG SPACE BALL GAME</i></h2>
<p>It was an unusual setting for
baseball. Instead of a blue sky, there was the
darkness of space and the brilliance of stars
overhead. The light of Earth flooded the scene,
and surrounding the oversized diamond were
the walls of Copernicus crater, over fifty miles
across.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>On the mound, Bill Cherry was pitching
practice balls to his catcher, Ollie Taylor.
Only underhand throwing was allowed in
baseball on the Moon, for the ball was exceedingly
fast in the light gravity and airlessness.
Bill, in snug-fitting space gear, was standing
farther than the regulation ninety feet from
the plate. This was because of the pitcher&rsquo;s
advantage over the batter in Lunar ball.</p>
<p>Bill wound up and threw. The ball shot like
a bullet into Ollie&rsquo;s double-padded mitt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thatta boy, Bill!&rdquo; Ollie&rsquo;s voice came over
Bill&rsquo;s space suit radio. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re this sharp
when we meet the Comets this afternoon,
we&rsquo;re bound to win our first championship!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough practice, fellows!&rdquo; Coach
Lippert called, coming out of the dugout. &ldquo;No
use giving our best before the game!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>It was the <i>big</i> game for the team from Plato,
which was tied with the league leaders in this
last game of the season. Plato was the farthest
colony on the Moon and was named for the
big crater in which it was located. Copernicus
colony, the baseball leader, had won the championship
every year since the school league had
been formed. As a prize, the champions were
always given a free rocket trip to Earth.</p>
<p>The Plato Rocketeers were homesick for
their mother planet. One of them, little Pete
Irby, had never set foot there. He had been
born on the Moon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be wonderful to go around without
even a space suit on like they do on Earth!&rdquo;
Pete said wistfully to Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Pete,&rdquo; Bill said confidently.
&ldquo;I have a feeling that this is our year and that
we&rsquo;re all going to Earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure hope you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Pete replied,
with great feeling. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to see the great
national parks and rivers and all the other
wonderful things there!&rdquo;</p>
<hr /><p class="tb">At game time the grandstand was filled and
some people were standing. It was the largest
crowd ever to see a ball game on the Moon.
Much of the crowd was made up of hopeful
parents from the Plato colony who had come
seven hundred miles by rocket plane to see
their boys play.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>The champion Copernicus Comets ran out
onto the field in big bouncing strides. For on
the Moon a person was capable of jumping
and running in great leaps because of the low
gravity, only one-sixth of Earth&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The Plato Rocketeers were the visiting
team would bat first. When the outfielders
had taken their positions, they were tiny forms
far out in the distance with nothing but gray
wilderness behind them for a backstop. There
were eleven men in Moon baseball because
of this greater outfield range. Two extra fielders
played behind the shortstop and second
baseman and were called &ldquo;short fielders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill noticed a wheel chair below the railing
of the grandstand. His mother and dad had
brought his crippled younger brother Skippy
to see the game! Bill had known his parents
were going to rocket over from Plato in time
for the game, but they had not said Skippy
would come along. Bill gave Skippy a wave
and his little brother waved back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>The lead-off batter for the Rocketeers
walked to the plate swinging a bat, padded to
keep it from hitting the ball too hard and
far. The Comets&rsquo; ace pitcher, Carl Cadman,
hurled three fast strikes over almost before the
batter had gotten a good foothold. Carl struck
out the next batter as well and then forced
little Pete Irby to loft a high infield fly for the
third out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get &rsquo;em, Bill!&rdquo; Ollie said excitedly as
the Rocketeers took the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sure try,&rdquo; Bill promised his catcher.</p>
<p>Bill took the mound. With his space gloves
he massaged rosin into the baseball. After getting
the signal from Ollie, Bill swung his arm
down and around. The batter swung sharply,
driving the ball toward third. The baseman
made a dive for the ball, but he missed it. His
body seemed to glide in slow motion in the
light gravity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>Bill walked the next batter, making two on
and none out. Jack Brenna, the Comets&rsquo; heaviest
hitter, was up. Bill got two strikes on him
and then Jack took a better toehold. As Bill
saw bat and ball connect solidly on the next
pitch, his heart fell.</p>
<p>The ball arched like a comet across the dark
sky. The left fielder took a dozen giant steps
after the ball but then gave up. The ball
seemed to be going for miles. It was a home
run.</p>
<p>The Comets did not score anymore that inning,
but the damage seemed to be already
done. The champions were leading 3-0.</p>
<p>Bill was first up for the Rocketeers. As he
went to the plate swinging a bat, his eye caught
Skippy&rsquo;s wheel chair, and he saw his game
little brother waving encouragement. It made
him want to try even harder to put his team
out in front. Bill knew he would have to do it
with his hitting, since he had failed as a
pitcher.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>But Bill got no closer to a hit than a long
foul into the stands. Then he struck out. The
two teammates following him also failed to get
on base.</p>
<p>The game moved along with no more scoring
for the next five innings. It was still 3-0.</p>
<p>In the last of the seventh inning the Plato
Rocketeers had more trouble. The first Comet
batter topped the ball slowly to Pete at shortstop,
who tried too hard to make the play.
The ball rolled between his legs and the runner
went all the way to second.</p>
<p>Pete was so busy grumbling about his last
error that he muffed the next play too. He
jumped ten feet into the air trying to reach
the high, bounding ball, but he misjudged it
and it went on past. The runner on second
loped down to third in long strides. Bill called
time in order to give Pete a chance to settle
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never win this game!&rdquo; Pete groaned.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you fellows say I&rsquo;m not any good&mdash;like
you&rsquo;re thinking!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop talking like that!&rdquo; Bill told him over
his suit radio. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking too much
about going to Earth, Pete. You&rsquo;re trying <i>too</i>
hard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to do better,&rdquo; Pete promised.</p>
<p>The next batter drove a high fly to center,
sending the runner in from third and making
the score 4-0. Bill walked the player following,
but then he was lucky enough to strike out the
hard-hitting Jack Brenna.</p>
<p>The next Comet drove a hard liner to Pete.
Pete scrambled for the ball, but once again
he muffed it and it went on into the outfield.
The shortfielder recovered it quickly but
threw wide to third, sending the runner into
the plate with the Comets&rsquo; fifth run.</p>
<p>When Bill looked at Pete, the little fellow
had thrown his big fielder&rsquo;s glove into the air
and was beginning to walk broken-heartedly
off the diamond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pete!&rdquo; Bill heard Coach Lippert call
sharply over his suit radio as he ran onto the
field. &ldquo;Get back to your position, son! I don&rsquo;t
like a quitter on my team.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>Players and coach huddled in the infield.
They looked like a gathering of teddy bears
in the space suits. Bill could see tears of bitterness
inside Pete&rsquo;s plastic helmet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellows,&rdquo; the coach said, &ldquo;what did we
come seven hundred miles across the Moon to
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To play ball,&rdquo; someone answered, &ldquo;&mdash;and
win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then. What do you say we start
doing it? Pete, I&rsquo;m going to send you to left
field where you used to play. Dan, in left field,
will take your place at shortstop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rocketeers retired the side without
further scoring. Then as though to prove that
the pep talk had helped, the team came up
with three big runs of their own!</p>
<p>Pitching with all his skill, Bill was able to
set down the Comets in order. It was now the
top half of the ninth inning, the last chance
for Plato to win the game. They were still behind
5-3, and the two-run lead seemed as big
as the Milky Way to Bill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>Dan started it off by walloping a double
down the right field line. Pete followed with a
single that bounced high over the right shortfielder&rsquo;s
head. The fielder behind him took the
ball and threw quickly to his catcher to keep
Dan from scoring off third. But then the
Rocketeers&rsquo; luck seemed to have run out as the
next two players struck out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all up to you, Bill,&rdquo; the coach told his
pitcher as Bill selected his favorite bat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be swinging, coach,&rdquo; Bill said determinedly.</p>
<p>He looked toward the stands as he walked to
the plate. Skippy was waving encouragement
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one is for you, Skippy,&rdquo; Bill murmured,
stepping up to the plate.</p>
<p>Carl tried to make him swing on two bad
pitches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Careful,&rdquo; Bill warned himself. &ldquo;There are
two outs&mdash;only one more left to us in the whole
game!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>The next ball was just the one Bill wanted.
He swung with all his might. He saw the ball
rise and lose itself in the white dust of starlight
overhead. And then he was off!</p>
<p>Loping past second, he saw the left fielder
still bounding like a rabbit after the ball. The
coach slowed him up on third base.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy, Bill,&rdquo; he said with a happy
grin. &ldquo;That ball is on the dark side of the
Moon by now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill could see the Plato rooters waving their
arms wildly in glee, and his radio picked up
their loud cheers. As he crossed the plate with
the leading run, he waved to Skippy who was
almost out of his wheel chair in his excitement
over his big brother&rsquo;s tingling homer.</p>
<p>The score: Plato 6, Copernicus 5. The game
was far from over, though. The Comets still
had their last turn at bat.</p>
<p>Bill got the first player to raise a high infield
pop-up. In the Moon&rsquo;s light gravity it
seemed as if the ball would never come down.
But it finally did, and Dan took it for the first
out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>Bill walked the next Comet, to put one on
and with one out. The following batter forced
the runner at second, making it two out and
giving Bill a much more confident feeling.</p>
<p>But then up to the plate walked Jack
Brenna!</p>
<p>Bill swallowed hard and began to sweat inside
his space suit. He failed to get the ball
over the plate on the first two pitches. Jack
swung on the next pitch and sent a hard foul
ball behind third base.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be careful,&rdquo; Bill thought. &ldquo;A homer
with the man on base will win the game for
the Comets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill came though with a fast ball. Jack met
it squarely and as the ball towered high over
the infield, Jack felt all quivery and weak. He
turned his head regretfully and saw the ball
rising high and far against the midnight black
of space. He saw little Pete Irby galloping
away from the diamond as fast as he could go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get it, Pete!&rdquo; Bill pleaded under his
breath. &ldquo;Please get it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>Everybody in the stands was on his feet.
This was the play that would decide the game&mdash;and
the championship.</p>
<p>Pete finally made a last second leap that
brought him twenty feet off the ground. Bill
could hardly see ball and glove meet. But they
did meet and Pete had done the impossible!</p>
<p>They had won!</p>
<p>The Rocketeers whirled the coach and Bill
easily up on their shoulders, because of the
light Lunar weight. Then they began parading
happily around the diamond to celebrate
their very first championship. When Pete had
made the long trip in from the outfield, he too
was carried around on his teammates&rsquo; shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a swell catch, Pete!&rdquo; Bill called
out to the little fellow. &ldquo;You sure saved the
day for us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what, Bill?&rdquo; Pete said, grinning.
&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d missed that ball I would have kept on
running&mdash;yep, right into space! I was determined
to make that trip to Earth one way or
another!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="27" /></div><h2 id="c13"><br /><i>PAPER TREASURE FOR MARS</i></h2>
<p>Hugh Davone and Link Malloy
sat at the wall desk of the space ship compartment
poring over their albums of interplanetary
postage stamps. The atom-powered
<i>Princess of Mars</i>, cargo and passenger liner,
was only a few hours out on its Earth-to-Mars
run.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;It makes me nervous thinking of the thousands
of dollars&rsquo; worth of stamps we&rsquo;re carrying
in the wall safe,&rdquo; Link said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
I&rsquo;m going to enjoy this trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy, Link,&rdquo; Hugh replied, with
a lighthearted grin. &ldquo;There are Space Guardsmen
aboard ship to protect us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fellows were on their annual vacation
from the Space Cadet Corps. Since cadets in
training could ride any space ship free, the
two were escorting a valuable shipment of Mr.
Davone&rsquo;s interplanetary stamps to another
dealer opening up shop in Mars City.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m worrying about that white-haired old
character your dad said asked suspicious questions
at his shop the other day,&rdquo; Link said.
&ldquo;Seems funny that he is making the trip to
Mars the same time we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably only a coincidence,&rdquo; Hugh answered.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one flight a month to
Mars, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are unscrupulous dealers who would
give anything to lay their hands on our shipment,&rdquo;
Link went on. &ldquo;This deal means an
awful lot to your dad&rsquo;s stamp business, Hugh.
If we should bungle the job, he certainly
would lose a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure he would,&rdquo; Hugh agreed, then he
added, &ldquo;but we aren&rsquo;t going to bungle it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed to satisfy Link and a smile of
confidence deepened the corners of his broad,
friendly mouth.</p>
<p>Hugh picked up a stamp with his tongs. &ldquo;I
came across this duplicate from the Venus
pictorial issue. It&rsquo;s the six-dollar blue of the
Valley of Mists. Have you got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Link leaned over. &ldquo;No! What have you
been doing, Hugh, holding out on me? How
about some of my 2027 Lunar commems in
trade?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>They worked out an exchange. The Lunar
stamps were curious specimens, imperforate
and circular. They depicted the Lunar hemisphere
which faces Earth. The single-stamp
issue had been distributed on the fiftieth anniversary
of man&rsquo;s first landing on the moon
and was much in demand.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a knock on the outer
door of the compartment.</p>
<p>Hugh got up and went to the door. As he
walked, his magnetic-sole shoes rasped against
the metallic floor like a knife being honed. He
opened the door.</p>
<p>A man with the face and build of a leprechaun
looked at Hugh. His pale but alert blue
eyes peered steadily into Hugh&rsquo;s. Hugh also
began to wonder why this customer at Davone&rsquo;s
Philatelic Shop should be making the
voyage to Mars with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir?&rdquo; Hugh asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; the man asked. &ldquo;My name
is Oscar Benasco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh hesitated, thinking about the valuable
cargo, then he replied reluctantly,
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your father certainly has a fine shop, Hugh
Davone,&rdquo; the elderly man said brightly as he
entered. &ldquo;However, I was disappointed to find
out that he had packed up some of his choicest
space items and was selling them to Mr. Elfs,
a dealer on Mars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know quite a lot, Mr. Benasco,&rdquo; Link
remarked coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I pride myself on my shrewdness,&rdquo;
Mr. Benasco replied in a modest manner. His
roving eyes came to rest on the boys&rsquo; albums.
&ldquo;I see you two have collections of your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing very valuable,&rdquo; Hugh replied.
&ldquo;But we enjoy our stamps just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; Benasco said. His eyes brightened
with eagerness and he placed the tips of
his outspread fingers together. &ldquo;Speaking of
valuable items&mdash;those you are taking to Mars&mdash;no
doubt you keep them in your compartment
safe. I wonder if you might show them
to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mr. Benasco,&rdquo; Hugh said, &ldquo;but
I promised my dad I wouldn&rsquo;t take the stamps
out to show anyone until they were safely in
the hands of Mr. Elfs on Mars.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>Benasco looked completely crestfallen. His
rounded shoulders slumped and the most
pained expression covered his face. &ldquo;Surely
just a look&mdash;&rdquo; he pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are going to Mars, as you must be,&rdquo;
Hugh went on, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be able to see them all
in Mr. Elfs&rsquo;s shop, and you can talk to him
about any stamps you might want to buy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s your final answer?&rdquo; Mr. Benasco
asked, his disappointment giving way
to annoyance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it must be,&rdquo; Hugh told him.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve disappointed me sorely, young
man,&rdquo; Mr. Benasco retorted. &ldquo;Good day to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned briskly and clattered out the
door. As he left, Hugh caught sight of the
handle of an old type miniature rocket pistol
protruding from his coat pocket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see that pistol?&rdquo; Link asked, in
surprise. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder he didn&rsquo;t hold us up
for the stamps right here and now! But I
guess he was afraid to risk it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a moment I almost felt sorry for him
and was about to give in,&rdquo; Hugh admitted.
&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the days that followed, Hugh and Link
saw little of Mr. Benasco except in the dining
room.</p>
<p>One morning, near the end of the flight,
Hugh and Link were standing in front of
their compartment port looking out. The
orange-red globe of Mars was so dominant
that it seemed to press back the surrounding
stars and nebulae to near obscurity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a few more days and our shipment
will be safely in the hands of Mr. Elfs in Mars
City,&rdquo; Hugh said. &ldquo;Then Mr. Benasco will be
Mr. Elfs&rsquo;s worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be just dandy as far as I&rsquo;m concerned,&rdquo;
Link replied earnestly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>By this year of 2031, space mail service had
increased to such proportions that it had
opened up a brand new field of stamp specialization
for the philatelist. It was for this reason
that Mr. Elfs was attempting a stamp hobby
business in Mars City. Mr. Davone&rsquo;s portfolios
of both low and high values was to provide
him with the bulk of his opening merchandise.</p>
<p>Even the most remote colonies of the Solar
System, including the farthest on Triton, Neptune,
had their own postage by now. The lone
Triton bi-color, picturing Valhalla Peak, tallest
mountain yet discovered in the System, was
one of the most wanted by collectors.</p>
<p>Suddenly the chimes for lunch were heard
over the compartment intercom.</p>
<p>Entering the dining room, Hugh and Link
saw Benasco in his usual place at the end of
the table near the door. They took their seats
and Link smiled at his plate. &ldquo;Cubed beef,
Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh grinned. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say they don&rsquo;t
aim to please on the <i>Princess of Mars</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>But the fellows did not get to finish their
cubed roast, nor did anyone else at the table.</p>
<p>A shock hit the ship like an unheralded
thunderbolt. Hugh had the crazy feeling of
being in a nightmare. After the deafening report,
he felt his lap belt snap, and then he was
hoisted out of his chair as though in the vortex
of a whirlwind. The table tore loose from the
floor fittings. Hugh bounced into a coffee urn
and it nearly stunned him. Groans of distress
from those around him filled his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; Hugh thought
dazedly.</p>
<p>The ship&rsquo;s disaster siren pealed along the
corridors of the <i>Princess of Mars</i>. Medical men
with stretchers came running and officers
snapped out brisk orders. Hugh groped anxiously
through the melee for Link. He struggled
over twisted chair tubing and found his
friend helping those who were hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got work to do,&rdquo; Link told him.</p>
<p>Hugh rolled up his sleeves. He was still
giddy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>It was reported later that there were no
fatalities, but there were enough injured persons
to keep the infirmary staff busy for awhile.</p>
<p>Hugh and Link, working side by side with
the medical men, had not seen anything of
Benasco since the accident. The ship&rsquo;s engineers
revealed that a meteorite had caused
the disaster. It had struck fairly close to the
compartment occupied by Hugh and Link.
Hugh shuddered to think what it would have
been like to have been tossed about in their
room like a pea in a whistle. Such would have
been his and Link&rsquo;s fate had the strike occurred
half an hour earlier.</p>
<p>The cadets had not yet had the opportunity
to check their quarters for damage. When the
physician in charge finally freed them with
thanks for their help, Hugh thought about
the stamps for the first time since the unnerving
incident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Link,&rdquo; he said urgently, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to get
back and check on those stamps! This has been
a perfect set up for Benasco and his scheme!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right behind you,&rdquo; Link said as they hurried
from the infirmary.</p>
<p>Along the way, the two found warped walls
and doors that had been flung open. Luckily
all the occupants in the worst-hit area had
been in the dining room at the terrible moment,
or there surely would have been fatalities.</p>
<p>Reaching their compartment, Hugh and
Link found that the door had been forced
open by the explosion.</p>
<p>Hugh hurried over to the wall safe. He felt
a chill of dread race through him. The vault
door also was open and the chamber was
empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re gone!&rdquo; Hugh said hoarsely. &ldquo;All
of Dad&rsquo;s stamps are gone!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>Hugh slumped remorsefully on his cot, taut
fingers combing through his hair. &ldquo;Dad
wanted to have the stamps insured,&rdquo; he said
bitterly, &ldquo;but I was trying to save him money.
The insurance fee was enormous, and on top
of that he would have had to pay the fare both
to and from Mars for the agents who would
carry the shipment. How I wish they had done
it now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Benasco has the stamps, we may still be
able to recover them,&rdquo; Link said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go
see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh got up, his face set, his palm shaped
into a fist. &ldquo;If Benasco <i>is</i> the one, I&rsquo;ll personally&mdash;oh,
never mind! Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They moved down corridor &ldquo;E,&rdquo; which was
away from the center of the damage. This was
the hall where they knew Benasco&rsquo;s room was
located. Scarcely anybody was in the section
at present. Those who resided in the nearby
rooms were either helping out in the emergency,
or they were idly watching the beginning
of repairs. The outside meteor bumper
and the inner buffer bulkheads had kept the
destruction to a minimum. By automatically
sealing themselves off from the rest of the ship
at the moment of impact, the protective bulkheads
had kept the ship from being decompressed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>Hugh and Link found their suspect&rsquo;s door
closed. Hugh walked up to it and tried the
knob.</p>
<p>The door opened under Hugh&rsquo;s push, but
the compartment was vacant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; Link said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be somewhere close by,&rdquo; Hugh
returned impatiently. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t passed him
on the way, so he must be farther down the
corridor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s looking for a place to hide the
portfolios until we land,&rdquo; Link suggested. &ldquo;He
knows we&rsquo;ll suspect him of taking them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh nodded. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the two moved ahead down the quiet
passageway, Link spoke in a tense voice, &ldquo;Do
you think we&rsquo;re right trying to tackle that little
guy alone? We&rsquo;re each bigger than he is, but
he&rsquo;s got a pistol and we haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be careful,&rdquo; Hugh promised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>There were a number of storerooms lining
the corridor. The cadets checked one after another.
The rooms were shrouded in tomblike
silence and full of dark hiding places. But the
search revealed no sign of Benasco or the missing
portfolios.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to have disappeared right into
the air,&rdquo; Link said discouragingly. &ldquo;Hugh, I
hate to say it, but something tells me we aren&rsquo;t
going to see either Benasco or those stamps
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were approaching the door of an
outer-ship repair room. Hugh knew that a
ladder in this room led directly up to the outside
hull of the ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re probably thinking along the same
lines that I am, Link,&rdquo; Hugh replied gravely.
&ldquo;It may be farfetched, but a person as shrewd
as Mr. Benasco makes out to be might have
cooked up a pretty clever plan. He may have
had a portable transmitter hidden somewhere
so that he could contact another party outside
the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;I get it!&rdquo; Link said. &ldquo;He might have radioed
this crony in a space taxi to meet him on
the outer skin. Then they could both take off
with the loot and either land on Mars or on
one of the moons!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Link spoke, Hugh was staring through
the plastic window of the room. A wall hid
much of the interior from view. Suddenly he
saw the very man they were seeking cross the
room and disappear beyond the corner of the
concealing wall.</p>
<p>Link caught a glimpse of him too. &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;
he burst out. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that <i>him</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure was,&rdquo; Hugh replied, feeling better
now. &ldquo;He probably just entered the room
from another door along the next side corridor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh gently turned the knob and the door
swung open soundlessly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll slip in softly,&rdquo;
he whispered. &ldquo;Then we can try to take him
by surprise around the corner up ahead. We&rsquo;ll
have to watch our step because he&rsquo;s probably
desperate and will have his pistol ready for use.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;He deserves to get twenty years for a theft
like this,&rdquo; Link whispered fiercely. &ldquo;How did
he ever expect to get away with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>won&rsquo;t</i> get away with it,&rdquo; Hugh whispered
confidently. &ldquo;Right now he&rsquo;s probably
getting into a space suit so he can pop through
the outer hatch and join his confederate outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had reached the corner on tiptoe.
Hugh, in the lead, peered carefully around
the corner. He gaped in surprise at what he
saw:</p>
<p>Benasco was seated on the floor like a child
with a new scrapbook, and he was chattering
away ecstatically to himself!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, oh, my, what a splendid group!&rdquo; he
was saying. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a <i>tete beche</i> pair of old
1989 Space Stations I&rsquo;ve always wanted! And
look at this one&mdash;a full sheet of Europa triangles!
Oscar Benasco will have the most
splendid collection of space stamps in all the
Solar System!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>

<p class="caption"><i>Benasco was seated on the floor like a child with a new scrapbook</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>Hugh came out of hiding, followed by Link.
&ldquo;The jig&rsquo;s up, Mr. Benasco,&rdquo; Hugh said.
&ldquo;How about returning our property?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man was so preoccupied that he
did not notice Hugh and Link immediately.
&ldquo;Dear, dear,&rdquo; he purred, &ldquo;what a beautiful
set of Einstein memorial surcharges! I wonder
if young Davone will break up the set? I
have some of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just a queer old guy,&rdquo; Link remarked
as the two of them strode up to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hello, boys,&rdquo; Mr. Benasco greeted
them casually. &ldquo;I was hoping I&rsquo;d found a place
where I wouldn&rsquo;t be disturbed for awhile. I
knew you&rsquo;d come by my room. I hope you
don&rsquo;t mind the liberty I&rsquo;ve taken with your
stamps. But I did <i>ask</i> to see them and you
refused, you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh took from him the portfolio he was
holding. &ldquo;How many stamps have you removed
from here?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>The man&rsquo;s snowy brows went up in surprised
indignation. &ldquo;Removed?&rdquo; he shrilled,
his face coloring. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been accused of
stealing in my life, sir! I merely borrowed your
collection to see if it has the items I need.
When the explosion blew open your safe, it
was simply a temptation I could not resist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those rare items you need cost money,&rdquo;
Hugh reminded him. &ldquo;Lots of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; Mr. Benasco grunted, &ldquo;you
do not need to tell me of the value of postage
stamps. I&rsquo;m well acquainted with Scott&rsquo;s catalogue.
I have every intention of paying for
my merchandise.&rdquo; He pulled out such a wad
of bills that Link gasped. &ldquo;You see, I <i>can</i> pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about that rocket pistol you&rsquo;re carrying
in your pocket, Mr. Benasco?&rdquo; Link
asked suspiciously. &ldquo;Do you always go around
armed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this?&rdquo; the old man asked, taking out
the rusted miniature model. &ldquo;This is nothing
but an old relic of mine when I was a space
hand myself on a freighter. I carry it with me
sometimes, because it gives me a feeling of confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>Hugh chuckled as a vast feeling of relief
came over him. &ldquo;You certainly had us fooled,
Mr. Benasco. We thought surely you were a
stamp thief out to steal our valuable stamps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps my methods have puzzled you
somewhat,&rdquo; Mr. Benasco declared. &ldquo;But I
had to see those rarities before you got rid of
them. Somebody might have bought them before
I could. Perhaps Mr. Elfs would have
held them out for his own collection. You
must sell them to me, young man! I believe I
should die if I could not get them! Stamps
represent the only pleasure that is left to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Mr. Benasco, since it means so
much to you,&rdquo; Hugh agreed, smiling. &ldquo;Being
a hobbyist myself, I know what a hold stamps
can have on a person. We&rsquo;ll take the portfolios
back to our compartment and discuss the
stamps you want. But if my father or Mr. Elfs
complains about this, you&rsquo;ll have to share the
blame.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly, gladly,&rdquo; was the willing reply.
&ldquo;Do you mind telling us why you&rsquo;re going
to Mars, Mr. Benasco?&rdquo; Link asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a son there working on a canal
project. He invited me and my stamp collection
to come and stay as long as I liked, since
I had lived with my other son so long in the
States. I thought it was nice of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Hugh and Link were leading the way
out of the room, the portfolios safely tucked
under their arms, Hugh remarked in a whisper
to his pal, &ldquo;Link, I&rsquo;ll never prejudge another
person as long as I live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Link stole a look back at Mr. Benasco who
was clicking along behind and smiling rapturously.
&ldquo;That calls for a mutual pledge, Hugh,&rdquo;
Link replied soberly, with a shake of his head.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s shake on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they did.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
